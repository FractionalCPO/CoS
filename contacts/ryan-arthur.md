## Relationship Context

- Hired ~Oct 2025 as Chief of Staff at fCPO
- **Terminated Feb 12, 2026** — final date March 14. Cost-driven ($264K/yr = $22K/month)
- Was characterized as "EA-level (inbox, calendar, small tasks) rather than Chief of Staff"
- Had the most intense daily cadence: 2x daily check-ins + standup + bench review
- Vahid described him as "emotionally regulated and proactive" but proactivity was on task execution, not strategic thinking
- Vahid delayed giving feedback due to shame — a self-identified pattern
- Previous role: Anteroom Partners

## Communication Style

- High-frequency: daily 30-min check-ins (Mon-Thu), 1hr Fridays, daily wrap
- Email (33), calendar (5 logged but many recurring), messages (44)
- Responsive and task-oriented

## Key Lessons (for Donna/CoS replacement)

- Ryan was $264K/yr for EA-level work
- Needed "frequent feedback" — couldn't operate autonomously at CoS level
- Tendency to overcommit
- The role needs strategic synthesis, not just task execution
