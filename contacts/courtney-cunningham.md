## Relationship Context

- Business partner and strategic ally — the operational counterweight to Vahid
- Vahid uses Courtney as a sounding board before hard decisions (Ryan comp, Mauricio terms, Ali termination)
- Provides financial reality checks Vahid sometimes avoids
- "Package deal" for client engagements — she handles recruiting (10 calls/week), financial oversight, operations
- Vahid = sales, strategy, client relationships. Courtney = financial oversight, recruiting, operations
- Daily standup, weekly 1:1, bench + sales review (Mon 1pm)
- Clay groups: Starred

## Communication Style

- Direct and open — they discuss compensation, partnership terms, and personnel issues candidly
- Vahid admits emotional blocks to her (shame, avoidance) — high trust
- Weekly strategic 1:1 runs longer than typical meetings
- Multi-channel: email (326), calendar (282 events), messages (108)

## Personal Notes
