# Goals — Your Quarterly Objectives
#
# This file is the source of truth for "what should I be working on?"
# Claude references it constantly when prioritizing your time,
# triaging your inbox, and deciding what meetings to accept.
#
# Update quarterly. Review weekly.
#
# How to use:
#   - Define 3-5 objectives (fewer is better)
#   - Each objective should be specific, measurable, and time-bound
#   - Include key results that define success
#   - Update progress (0.0 to 1.0) as you make headway
#   - Claude will flag when progress stalls
