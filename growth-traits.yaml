# Growth Traits — For The Mirror
#
# Traits Donna evaluates against meeting transcripts weekly.
# Each trait has a "strength" expression and a "growth edge."
# The Mirror looks for specific moments in transcripts that
# demonstrate either the strength or the growth edge.

traits:
  - name: "Direct communication"
    strength: "States direction clearly. Reframes problems. Doesn't hedge with clients or prospects."
    growth_edge: "Avoids hard conversations with team/partners when shame is involved. Delays negative feedback."
    look_for:
      strength: "Gave clear, direct feedback to someone. Named a problem without softening."
      edge: "Deferred a conversation. Used proxy (Courtney) instead of speaking directly. Avoided a topic."

  - name: "Decisive action"
    strength: "Decides fast in meetings. Doesn't defer to 'let's think about it.' Reframes then acts."
    growth_edge: "Decisiveness breaks down around people/compensation decisions. Shame causes paralysis."
    look_for:
      strength: "Made a call in the meeting. Stated direction without seeking consensus."
      edge: "Said 'let's revisit' or 'I need to think about it' on a people issue. Deferred a decision he already knows the answer to."

  - name: "Closing loops"
    strength: "Finishes things. Gets energy from completion. Documents to calm the mind."
    growth_edge: "Opens new workstreams before closing existing ones. ADHD-driven context switching."
    look_for:
      strength: "Completed or shipped something. Marked a task done. Closed a thread."
      edge: "Started discussing a new project while existing ones are unfinished. Jumped topics without resolution."

  - name: "Authority and ownership"
    strength: "Takes full ownership of strategy, messaging, client relationships. Leads with expertise."
    growth_edge: "Frustration when others don't match his standard. Can become a bottleneck by retaining too much."
    look_for:
      strength: "Empowered someone else to own a decision. Delegated with trust."
      edge: "Took back work from someone. Edited heavily instead of coaching. Expressed frustration at output quality."

  - name: "Vulnerability and self-awareness"
    strength: "Admits his blocks openly (shame, avoidance, ADHD). Does therapy. Practices Vipassana."
    growth_edge: "Awareness doesn't always translate to action. Knows the pattern but still repeats it."
    look_for:
      strength: "Named an emotional block in real-time. Acted on a known pattern instead of repeating it."
      edge: "Described a pattern he's aware of but didn't change behavior. Intellectualized without acting."

  - name: "Relationship investment"
    strength: "Values relationships deeply. Maintains key contacts. Goes to events. Builds genuine rapport."
    growth_edge: "Lets maintenance slip under pressure. Tier 1 contacts can go 14+ days without touchpoint."
    look_for:
      strength: "Reached out proactively. Prioritized a relationship touchpoint over work."
      edge: "Realized he hasn't contacted someone important in weeks. Relationship maintenance deferred."

  - name: "Energy management"
    strength: "Knows what energizes him (finishing, building, networking). Active health routine."
    growth_edge: "Makes high-stakes decisions under fatigue. Post-CTCT burnout led to costly decisions."
    look_for:
      strength: "Protected energy. Said no to something draining. Chose the energizing path."
      edge: "Pushed through fatigue on an important decision. Skipped health/recovery for work."

  - name: "Scope discipline"
    strength: "Hates scope creep. Explicit about trade-offs. Pushes back on expanding scope."
    growth_edge: "Sometimes expands his own scope (new tools, new projects) while preaching discipline."
    look_for:
      strength: "Pushed back on scope expansion. Named a trade-off explicitly."
      edge: "Added a new project/tool/initiative mid-sprint. Said yes to something without dropping something else."
