## A. Communication Style (By Channel)

### Slack (Team Channels)

Vahid is a **low-volume, high-signal** communicator on Slack. Across 555 messages in 7 channels, he posted sparingly — maybe 10-15% of total messages. Most active posters are Mauricio and Courtney.

**Characteristics:**
- All lowercase, always: "what's the purpose of having this channel?", "i recently lost mine", "i'll lyk when i find it"
- Extremely brief — most messages are 1 sentence, rarely exceeds 2
- Uses texting shorthand: "u", "lyk" (let you know), "td" (today), "w" (with), "coz", "fk", "ya", "imo", "plmk" (please let me know)
- Light emoji use: `:sob:`, `:smile:`, `:saluting_face:`, `:slightly_smiling_face:`, `:raised_hands:` — but not excessive, maybe 1 emoji per 5 messages
- Drops articles and pronouns: "signed up for gamma.app but haven't tested fully yet"
- Shares links with brief hot takes: ".... And half the AI companies just went out of business" (on OpenAI AgentKit)
- Responds to humor with one-word reactions: "gangster"
- On sales channels, slightly more structured but still concise and directive: "our best next step is connecting w Jill. we always close if our first point-of-contact is the CEO/top leader."

**Sales/Prospect Channel Pattern:**
When engaging with external contacts (Bohdan/Trader prospect), Vahid shifts to slightly more polished but still casual:
- "we finished our 2025 financial report, made $3m CAD off of ConstantContact alone. excited to bring on Trader"
- "prob best to position as 'coexist' mainly to remove sales barriers"
- Still lowercase, still brief, but includes specific numbers and strategic framing
- Always ends with forward momentum: "excited for next steps!", "we'll follow your lead"

**What he doesn't do on Slack:**
- Never writes paragraphs
- Never uses corporate language
- Never sends messages that are purely social/meme-sharing (that's Mauricio's role)
- Rarely initiates casual conversation — joins existing threads with quick reactions

### Meetings (Verbal Patterns from Fellow/Granola)

Vahid's verbal style is distinctly different from his written — more expansive, more emotional, more pedagogical.

**Openers and fillers:**
- "Dude," and "Man" as casual openers — frequent
- "You know what I mean?" — constant alignment-checking tic
- "Yeah, yeah, yeah" — emphatic agreement pattern
- Heavy contraction use: "I'm gonna," "don't," "can't"

**Feedback delivery:**
- Direct and empathetic simultaneously — never softens the message but explains the "why" transparently
- Self-aware about failures: "that's just me being not as good a leader as I need to be"
- Self-deprecating but confident: "I got dead bodies everywhere" (about past decisions)
- Uses "radical candor" naturally without naming it every time

**Decision-making language:**
- "I just went Ham" — full commitment once decided
- "Yeah, I'm gonna run a test to see how it works" — experiment-first instinct
- "Anything works, right?" — pragmatic, not perfectionist
- "Maximum leverage with these guys right now"

**Coaching others (e.g., Ryan on outreach copy):**
- "This sentence is too wordy. Like we don't need a URL."
- "Second sentences in outreach messages should be extremely brief and light"
- "Write the whole essay, then keep only the conclusion"
- Teaches by stating the principle, then demonstrating it

**Strategic references in conversation:**
- "bank run effect" (cascade dynamics)
- 48 Laws of Power (favorite book)
- Shape Up vs sprints
- "I think coaches suck" — opinionated about methodologies
- Naturally uses restaurant/kitchen/chef analogies

### LinkedIn (Public Voice)

From the style guides and top-performing posts:

**Tone:** Blunt, stripped-down, confident. "Sounds like texting a smart, overloaded friend."

**Rules he follows:**
- Lowercase everything (except names, brands, countries)
- No emojis, no hashtags, no em-dashes
- Uses slang abbreviations: idk, td, imo, tf, nah
- Removes "i" unless essential
- Starts hot, ends clean, no soft landings
- Never softens a strong take
- Sometimes funny, never corny

**Post formats he rotates:**
1. Contrarian insight (challenges conventional wisdom)
2. Mini framework (3-5 actionable steps)
3. Corporate shitpost (blunt, no explanation, ends abruptly)
4. Opinion with challenge (question hook + stance + engagement question)
5. Five-step framework (sequential process)
6. Pithy wisdom (declarative + metaphor)
7. Corporate reality check / myth buster
8. Mindful insight (stillness meets leadership)
9. Weekend entertainment (humor, humanizing)

**Top performer example (4.68% engagement):**
> there are 5 simple steps to build anything for scale. ya must go in sequence!
> i often have to remind myself not skip. i always want to start automating something, before i've even documented it.

**Performance bar:** Post must trigger a DM, be cited in a call, or get 10k+ impressions without engagement bait. Otherwise delete or rewrite.

### Email (from CLAUDE.md preferences)

- Direct, casual-professional, no fluff
- Short sentences, 1-3 lines per paragraph
- Contractions always
- Signs off "Vahid" informally, full signature formally
- Never puts scheduling burden on recipient — always proposes specific times
- Blockquotes for key takeaways

### Personal Writing (Vulnerable Mode)

A completely separate register — all lowercase, fragmented, poetic:
> "a bit ago, i witnessed another life implosion. career, love, home, self, all crumbled. evident the old way didn't work. my anti-pattern was to do nothing."

References Rumi, Shams, Vipassana, inner child work. Signs off with "mad love." Drops pronouns and articles. This mode appears on personal Medium posts and Tumblr — never in professional contexts.

### Channel-by-Channel Summary

| Channel | Capitalization | Length | Tone | Emoji | Formality |
|---------|---------------|--------|------|-------|-----------|
| Slack (team) | all lowercase | 1 sentence | casual, brief | light | very low |
| Slack (prospects) | all lowercase | 2-3 sentences | casual-strategic | light | low-medium |
| Meetings (verbal) | n/a | expansive | direct, pedagogical | n/a | low |
| LinkedIn | all lowercase | varies by format | blunt, opinionated | never | medium |
| Email | standard caps | short paragraphs | casual-professional | rarely | medium-high |
| Personal writing | all lowercase | fragmented | vulnerable, poetic | never | none |

## B. Business Operations

### Company: FractionalCPO

**What it is:** Embedded product leadership for PE-backed SaaS companies. NOT consulting, NOT fractional work. Full-time placement with assessment-led entry.

**ICP:** PE-backed SaaS, $200M+ ARR, 4-6yr post-investment, seeking 3-5x exits in 5-7 years.

**Tagline:** "Revenue growth through product leadership for PE-backed companies"

**Service model:**
1. Assessment ($45k, 1 month) — Partners evaluate strategy/talent/ops/growth
2. Embedded team — Engagement manager + delivery consultants deployed full-time
3. Exit — Client hires team or transitions to advisory

**Four levers:** Product strategy, product team, product talent, product growth, product process. Product growth is the strongest differentiator.

### Financial Situation (Feb 2026)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current revenue | $0 |
| Cash reserves | $200K |
| Runway | ~6 weeks (fixed costs) |
| 2025 revenue | $3M CAD (all from CTCT) |
| 2026 target | $4M USD, 3 clients |
| Fixed expenses | ~$10K/month |

**Key constraint:** Went from $3M/year to $0 overnight when CTCT deal collapsed in Dec 2025. Vahid overplayed the solicitation fee negotiation (30% of salaries) while jet-lagged/burned out. All offers rescinded. 3 team members poached directly by client. This caused severe depression and self-blame.

### Pipeline (Feb 2026)

| Opportunity | Revenue Potential | Status | Priority |
|------------|-------------------|--------|----------|
| Tampa Bay Times | $45-50M org, needs product leadership | Nikhil sending one-pager | High |
| Trader | Fintech/automotive, 3mo-2yr | Active, 2nd meeting with VP Product done | High |
| Lightspeed | SaaS, billing/activation issues | Meeting with CRO pending | Medium |
| CTCT Revival | Consulting-only ~$300K | Board decision pending | Low probability |
| CTCT Competitors | ActiveCampaign + others | Targeting while case study fresh | Medium |

**Milestones:** 5 verified opportunities by March 1, 1 deal in negotiation by April 1.

### Sales Process

**Outbound machine:**
- Ali (brother) running LinkedIn outbound: 60 messages/day across 4 audience segments (CEO/CFO/COO, CPO, VP Product, Director)
- Tools: HeyReach (LinkedIn), Instant.ly (email), Apollo (enrichment), Vector (~60 website leads)
- LinkedIn posting: 36 posts published, scheduled through Jan 30
- Podcast: 9 episodes recorded, Izabela Russell producing

**Referral structure:**
- 10% first-year revenue (being revised to tiered: 20% for $200k deals, 15% for $500k, 7% for $1M+)
- Or 25% of first scope only
- Assessment referral: 25% of $45k

**Sales philosophy (from coaching Ryan and Slack messages):**
- Always connect with CEO/top leader first: "we always close if our first point-of-contact is the CEO/top leader"
- Position as "augmenting the CPO" not replacing
- "prob best to position as 'coexist' mainly to remove sales barriers"
- Avoid PE jargon like "turnaround" (implies cutting teams)
- Focus on financial outcomes for exec audience
- Outreach copy: "Write the whole essay, then keep only the conclusion"

### Rate Structure

| Role | Monthly Cost | Client Billing |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Senior delivery manager | $30K | $600K/year |
| Junior consultant | $20K | $400K/year |
| Target margin | — | 40% |

### Client Delivery Approach (from CTCT engagement)

Vahid's playbook at Constant Contact reveals his delivery methodology:

1. **Assessment first** — diagnose org, talent, strategy, growth capability
2. **Talent triage** — identify strong performers, exit low performers fast (cut team by 45% at CTCT)
3. **Flatten org** — remove management layers (2 VPs to 8 direct reports)
4. **Growth bands model** — organize by growth lever, not product area
5. **Experimentation velocity** — target 100+ experiments/quarter
6. **Tool deployment** — Reforge, Fellow, Cursor as standard toolkit
7. **Metrics obsession** — leading indicators (activation, engagement) over lagging (revenue)
8. **Results:** Best customer acquisition month in 11 years, doubled activation in 6 weeks, $2.6M net ads increase in 3 months

### Team Management Style

**Profit sharing model:**
- Vahid: 32.5%
- Courtney: existing % (undisclosed)
- Mauricio: 7.5%
- Delivery managers: 5% of account profit

**Hiring philosophy:** "Humble, curious, hungry." Low ego. Learned from Ryan hire ($22K/month too expensive): don't hire seasoned executives when you need hungry juniors. Next hire: product management student as EA/apprentice (~$90K vs Ryan's $264K).

**Personnel decisions are swift:**
- Ryan terminated Feb 2026 (cost-driven, $0 revenue)
- JP separated Jan 2026 ($1,000 settlement, access removed)
- Ali terminated Jan 2026 (GTM sync conflict)

**Rhythm with team:**
- Courtney: weekly 1:1, "package deal" for engagements, ~10 recruiting calls/week
- Ryan (when active): daily check-ins, managed admin/research/calendar
- Mauricio: client delivery, CTCT competitor strategy, LinkedIn content lead
- Nawid: strong loyalty, extended team

### IONODES Board Role

Stable advisory position providing:
- Product Strategy Committee membership
- Board meetings (next: Sep 24; AGM: May 7)
- Company growing: $5.8M (2025) to $12M target (2026)
- Jan 2026 was $900K revenue (nearly double budget)
- IoT/security sector credibility
- Montreal/Quebec government connections
- Action items: intro to City of Montreal digital transformation contacts

## E. Synthesis: Who Vahid Is as a Leader and Operator

Vahid is a **speed-obsessed, subtraction-oriented product leader** who builds by shipping fast and cutting what doesn't work — including people. He's at his best when embedded in a large org with a clear mandate to restructure and accelerate (the CTCT engagement is the proof point). He's at his most vulnerable when negotiating high-stakes deals under fatigue.

**Strengths:**
- Diagnostic speed — can assess an org's product dysfunction in weeks
- Talent triage — identifies who stays and who goes with conviction
- Growth methodology — experimentation velocity as a measurable outcome
- Tool deployment — brings a standard stack that compounds results
- Communication clarity — says what he means in fewer words than anyone

**Risks:**
- Overplays hand in negotiation when stressed/tired (CTCT collapse)
- Hires expensive when lean would do (Ryan at $22K/month)
- Currently at $0 revenue with 6-week runway — existential pressure
- High personnel turnover (14 deleted Slack accounts, 3 terminations in 2 months)
- Solo founder energy — Courtney is the only true partner, everyone else is dispensable

**What he needs from an AI Chief of Staff:**
1. Reduce decision load on low-leverage tasks
2. Keep pipeline moving without him touching every thread
3. Surface what matters, bury what doesn't
4. Draft communications in his exact voice (lowercase, brief, opinionated)
5. Never send anything without his approval
6. Anticipate before he asks
