## Matt Kaiser — CSO, VeraData

**Background:**
- BS International Business, University at Buffalo (1990–1994)
- Pre-VeraData: Director of Strategic Partnerships at **AccuData Integrated Marketing** — led a team of senior data analysts making recommendations to direct marketer clients. Same company Michael Peterman (founder/CEO) came from. This is the connective tissue of the founding team.
- Joined VeraData ~2009 as **EVP** (newly created role). Has been at the company ~15+ years.
- Title has evolved: EVP → Chief Strategy Officer. Some older data sources list him as COO but the veradata.com About page confirms him as CSO. He is not the COO.

**At VeraData:**
- One of the earliest executives; part of the original strategic build-out alongside Peterman
- Positioned as the "analytics philosophy" voice — the person who shapes how VeraData frames its Donor Science methodology to the market
- Quoted publicly: "Most direct marketers are using methodologies that are 20 years old. Multiple regression analysis used today is the same as was used by Readers Digest in the 1970s." — this is his core thesis
- Participated in joint VeraData/Funraise webinar on "Breaking Free from Tradition: How to Modernize Nonprofit Growth" — spoke about decision support helping nonprofits know "not only who they should communicate with, but when and how"
- If he initiated the prescriptive analytics pivot ~18 months ago (mid-2024), it aligns with the post-Beringer professionalization push and VeraData's Inc. 5000 growth trajectory

**Published views / public signal:**
- Skeptical of legacy nonprofit analytics; believes the industry is dramatically under-served by modern methods
- Framing is "decision support" not just "data" — wants nonprofits to act on insight, not just receive it
- No strong AI-hype language publicly; positions ML/AI as the engine, prescriptive outcomes as the product

**Key angles for the call:**
- He's the strategy brain — he cares about the "why" and the "what next," not the how
- The prescriptive analytics pivot was his initiative — lead with genuine curiosity about how he's seeing it land with clients
- He's been in nonprofit data for 15+ years. He's heard every vendor pitch. Don't sell product — sell thinking.
- His frustration is with the gap between what's possible and what most nonprofits are doing. Mirror that framing.

**Warm path:**
- Clay search: no record — not in Vahid's network
- Shared origin with Peterman at AccuData — if Peterman is already a warm contact, that's the bridge
- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-kaiser-289b141/

## Michael Kulpinski — COO, VeraData

**Note on spelling:** Sources split between "Kolpinski" and "Kulpinski." The veradata.com About page and ZoomInfo both use **Kulpinski**. Use that spelling when writing his name.

**Background:**
- Career has been entirely in **large-scale print/direct mail production and nonprofit marketing ops** — not a tech/analytics person, an execution and scale person
- **Moore Wallace** → Regional VP, Operations (business communications, financial services, supply chain)
- **RR Donnelley** → Platform VP (led multi-site US operational platforms; integration lead on a European acquisition)
- **Innovairre Communications** → Rose through: Global Senior VP Services → President International → President Global Agency → **President & COO**
  - Innovairre is a major player in nonprofit direct mail production and fundraising creative — major competitor/adjacent to VeraData's world
  - This is where he built his nonprofit sector expertise
- Joined VeraData after Beringer Capital acquisition (Oct 2022) — almost certainly a PE-placed hire to professionalize operations
- How long at VeraData: likely ~2–3 years, joining post-acquisition

**At VeraData:**
- Classic PE COO profile: operational rigor, process standardization, scaling infrastructure
- "Hair on fire" signals he's deep in operational execution — integrating Faircom and New River Communications acquisitions into the VeraData platform while managing growth
- No public quotes or press appearances found — he's not a public-facing exec; he runs the machine
- His Innovairre background means he understands nonprofit direct mail deeply — he's not a skeptic of the industry, he's a builder within it

**Key angles for the call:**
- His time is the scarcest resource. Get to the point fast.
- He cares about: throughput, cost reduction, integration quality, team capacity
- The acquisitions (Faircom, New River) are likely generating real operational pain — integration complexity is his current headache
- If fCPO is relevant, the angle is: scaling product org to match the operational scale he's already building on the ops side
- Don't pitch strategy to him — pitch delivery, structure, and accountability

**Warm path:**
- Clay search: no record — not in Vahid's network
- Innovairre background is a potential connector — anyone in the nonprofit direct mail world likely knows him
- ZoomInfo profile: https://www.zoominfo.com/p/Michael-Kulpinsky/3338946465

## Call Strategy

### What to lead with

**For Matt Kaiser (CSO):**
Lead with the prescriptive analytics pivot — specifically, what's changed in how clients are responding now vs. 18 months ago. He initiated it; he'll want to talk about whether it's working. Frame Vahid's interest as strategic curiosity, not vendor positioning. Let him take the call somewhere. Then find the product/delivery gap.

**For Michael Kulpinski (COO):**
Lead with his time. Acknowledge he's busy, state the purpose in one sentence, and get to the question. Ask about the operational integration challenges post-Faircom/New River acquisitions. That's his real work right now. Find where product org capacity is limiting what operations can deliver.

### Questions to ask

**Matt Kaiser:**
1. "When you initiated the prescriptive analytics push 18 months ago — what was the internal sell, and where's the adoption at now?"
2. "Where does the product roadmap bottleneck today — is it data, modeling, or client-side implementation?"
3. "Are you building the analytics capability in-house or is there a partner model for the science layer?"
4. "What does your ideal product org look like at your next stage of scale?"

**Michael Kulpinski:**
1. "Post-Faircom and New River — where are you in the integration? What's still messy?"
2. "Where does product org fit in your operational model — is it centralized or distributed across the acquired brands?"
3. "What's the capacity constraint that's keeping you up at night right now?"
4. "Is there a product leadership gap, or is it a process/execution gap?"

### What NOT to say

- Don't reference "fractional" or "interim" early — position as a senior product exec who works embedded, not a consultant
- Don't pitch breadth (all the things fCPO can do) — pick one problem and go deep on it
- Don't ask Kaiser about operational details — that's Kulpinski's domain
- Don't over-explain Vahid's background — they have context from the intro; use the time to learn theirs
- Don't use nonprofit sector jargon you don't own — they'll know immediately if it's borrowed fluency
- With Kulpinski: don't run long. He'll disengage. 20 minutes sharp, clear ask, clean exit.

### Strategic play
This is a PE-backed company at the professionalization inflection point. Beringer acquisition was 2022; they're 3 years into the build. Inc. 5000 #532 means revenue growth is real. The signal to find: is the product org keeping pace with the business growth and M&A activity, or is it lagging? That gap is the opening.
