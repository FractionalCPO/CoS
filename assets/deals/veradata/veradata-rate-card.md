# VeraData Rate Card — Internal Reference
**For:** Vahid's follow-up call with Dave Hinton (Beringer Capital)
**Context:** Dave said standard fCPO rates ($4,500/day product leader, $3,500/day director IC) are "bigger than they can bite off"
**VeraData profile:** 17-year-old nonprofit data analytics company, ~75 employees, $5-25M revenue range, Fort Myers FL, AI/agentic pivot underway

---

## Why We're Scaling Down

Standard rates are built for $100M+ companies with $50M+ product budgets. VeraData is:
- Pre-scale: ~75 people, likely $10-20M actual revenue
- Nonprofit data company, not a SaaS platform — margin structure is different
- In transition (nonprofit data science → AI/agentic product platform) — they haven't monetized the new model yet
- No existing product leadership infrastructure to plug into

The play here is an assessment-to-engagement path. Get in the door affordably, prove the value, convert to a 3-month minimum engagement.

## Offering 1: Product Assessment

**Duration:** 4 weeks (not 8 — smaller company, less surface area)
**Price:** $40,000–$60,000 fixed (scale to $50K as anchor)
**Delivery:** Vahid-led, 1 partner or senior consultant embedded part-time

### What's included

1. **Product org assessment** — Who's doing what, reporting structure, capability gaps, capacity vs. output ratio
2. **Roadmap audit** — Is the roadmap connected to business outcomes? Are priorities defensible? What's on there that shouldn't be?
3. **Prescriptive analytics product strategy** — Their core business. Where is the product relative to the market? What does a modern data-as-a-product platform look like? What's the competitive gap?
4. **AI/agentic readiness assessment** — This is the angle. VeraData is pivoting toward AI. What does that actually require from a product and org perspective? What's the gap between where they are and where they need to be to credibly call themselves an AI-first platform? Deliver a clear-eyed answer with a path forward.
5. **Team evaluation** — Who's strong, who's misaligned, what's missing. Delivered as a recommendation on product leadership structure (do they need a CPO hire? When? What profile?)
6. **Written recommendations package** — Not a slide deck. A working document with prioritized actions, sequencing, and a 12-month product leadership roadmap

### Comparison to Constant Contact

CTCT assessment was $150K+ but:
- $560M revenue company with a 40-person product org
- 6-week engagement with 3+ fCPO consultants
- Full org restructure, layoffs, growth band architecture

VeraData is ~30x smaller. $50K is proportional. It's also low-risk for them — one month, fixed cost, clear deliverables.

### Frame for the call

"The assessment de-risks everything that comes after it. You spend 4 weeks and $50K to know exactly what you're working with — product strategy, team capability, AI readiness — and then you decide what to do next. That's a lot cheaper than making a $250K CPO hire and finding out 6 months later it was the wrong person or the wrong mandate."

## Offering 2: Fractional Engagement

**Minimum:** 3 months
**Pace:** 3–4 days/week (not full-time — right-sized for a 75-person company)

### Daily rates (scaled)

| Role | Standard Rate | VeraData Rate |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| Product Leader (Vahid or senior partner) | $4,500/day | $3,000–$3,500/day |
| Director IC (delivery consultant) | $3,500/day | $2,500–$2,800/day |

Anchor at $3,200/day for the product leader. Room to go to $3,500 if they push on scope.

### Monthly retainer option (more digestible)

If day rates cause friction (and they will — Dave flagged this), flip to retainer framing:

| Retainer | What it buys |
|----------|-------------|
| **$45,000/month** | Product leader at 3 days/week. Strategy, roadmap, stakeholder alignment, AI product direction. |
| **$55,000/month** | Product leader + director IC. Full coverage: strategy + execution. |

3-month minimum = $135K–$165K total. That's the number to anchor in his head, not the daily rate.

### Engagement scope at this size

What 3-4 days/week buys VeraData at 75 people:
- Own the product strategy and roadmap
- Run weekly product operating cadence
- Lead AI product definition (what are they actually building, for whom, with what interface)
- Coach/elevate internal product talent
- Interface with engineering on sequencing and delivery
- Provide board-level product updates (Beringer will care about this)

What it doesn't include: engineering management, data science direction, sales enablement. Scope the boundaries clearly upfront.

## Offering 3: Assessment + Engagement Bundle

The cleanest pitch for a company that's never worked with fractional product leadership:

**Month 1:** Assessment — $50,000 fixed
**Months 2–4:** Fractional engagement — $45,000–$55,000/month
**Total 4-month commitment:** $185,000–$215,000

This gives Dave / Beringer a clean number to take to VeraData leadership. It also gives VeraData an off-ramp after the assessment if they want it — but in practice, if the assessment surfaces the right issues (and it will), they'll want to keep going.

The exit path: at the end of the engagement, fCPO either helps recruit the permanent product leader, or VeraData keeps the engagement running while they search. Either outcome is fine.

## Value Narrative

### The full-time hire alternative

A CPO or VP Product at VeraData's stage:
- **Base salary:** $200,000–$280,000 (senior, PE-backed company expectations)
- **Equity/options:** Expected but illiquid until exit
- **Benefits/overhead loaded cost:** 1.25–1.3x base = $250,000–$365,000 annually
- **Search process:** 3–6 months of open role. External recruiter = 20–25% of first-year base = $50K–$70K additional

Total cost to close a CPO hire: **$300,000–$435,000 in year one, before any actual product work happens.**

And Vahid's line about this: "It takes 6 quarters to know if a product leader is working. If you're wrong, you've spent $600K and lost 18 months."

### The fCPO alternative

3-month assessment + engagement at VeraData scale: **$185K–$215K**

What that buys:
- Immediate impact. No ramp time, no onboarding. Day 1, we're working.
- No long-term commitment. 3 months, then decide.
- Product leadership with PE-scale pattern matching. We've seen this playbook before.
- AI readiness assessment included — Beringer gets clarity on whether VeraData's AI pivot is real or aspirational before any further investment.
- Option to permanently hire our deployed person. If the engagement works and they want to hire the person we put in, that's a known path.

### Why Beringer should care

Dave is an operating partner. He's thinking about VeraData's exit trajectory.

The framing that lands for a PE operating partner:
- "You're not paying for fractional product leadership. You're paying to know what you have, and to make the AI pivot de-risked. If VeraData's value story is 'prescriptive analytics powered by agentic AI,' we need to make sure there's a real product under that narrative before the next raise or exit conversation."
- "If the assessment comes back and the answer is 'you need a full-time CPO,' we'll tell you that too. And we'll help you define the spec and recruit against it. That's worth $50K."

## Objection Handling

**"Rates are still too high"**
Offer the $45K/month retainer. If that's still too high: 2 days/week at $3,000/day = $24K–$26K/month. That's below the director IC standard rate and probably the floor where it's worth doing.

**"We need to think about it"**
The assessment is the low-risk entry. $50K, fixed, one month. They get a full product strategy deliverable regardless of what they decide to do next. There's no commitment beyond month 1.

**"Can we start with the assessment and see?"**
Yes, explicitly. That's the design. The assessment is a standalone product. The engagement is optional.

**"We're not ready to commit to 3 months"**
Counter: "The assessment gives you everything you need to make that decision. If after 4 weeks you decide the timing isn't right, you have a roadmap and a team assessment you can act on internally. You haven't lost anything."

**"We have internal product people"**
"Great — the assessment will tell us exactly what they're capable of and where the gaps are. That's valuable regardless. We're not here to replace internal talent; we're here to give them direction and a framework."

## Numbers to Have Ready

| Scenario | Total Cost |
|----------|-----------|
| Assessment only | $40K–$60K |
| 3-month engagement (product leader only) | $135K–$158K |
| 3-month engagement (product leader + director IC) | $180K–$210K |
| Assessment + 3-month engagement | $185K–$215K |
| Assessment + 6-month engagement | $320K–$380K |

For context: Beringer's Fund V is $475M. VeraData at $50K–$215K is rounding error at the fund level. The question for Dave is whether the value creation thesis is right, not whether they can afford it.

## What to Close On This Call

1. Get agreement that the assessment is the right starting point
2. Get Dave to pull in the VeraData CEO/COO for a discovery conversation (Vahid + VeraData leadership, not just Beringer)
3. Agree on a timeline — can assessment start in March?
4. Confirm: is this just VeraData, or does Dave want to discuss any other portfolio companies in parallel?

Don't leave without a specific next step and a date.
