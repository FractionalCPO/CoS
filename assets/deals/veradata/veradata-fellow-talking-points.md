# 2026-02-19 (or 2026-02-25) | VeraData — Product Assessment Discovery with Matt Kaiser & Michael Kolpinski

---

## Company

**VeraData** — veradata.com
- 17-year-old nonprofit data analytics company
- PE-backed by Beringer Capital (Fund II/IV)
- Core business: data services for nonprofits (historically descriptive/predictive analytics)
- Active pivot: 18 months into a shift toward prescriptive, always-on, multi-channel analytics
- Revenue model: analytics-driven services (not software products — Dave Hinton's framing)
- No classic engineering team — mostly data scientists, modelers, IT; external dev firm contracted for product build
- First and only product hire: Tom (ex-Axiom), built foundation but can't scale

---

## Contacts

**Matt Kaiser** — Chief Strategy Officer
- Prescriptive analytics vision owner
- Driving the 18-month pivot internally
- Likely the decision-maker on product direction and who they bring in

**Michael Kolpinski** — COO
- Operational lens — org structure, resourcing, cost discipline
- Will have the most pricing sensitivity; likely the one who'll push back on rates
- Needs to see ROI framing, not just product capability

**Dave Hinton** — Operating Partner, Beringer Capital
- Champion, not gatekeeper
- Introduced Vahid to this opportunity
- Not a blocker — already aligned on bringing in product leadership
- Key dynamic: PE firms want exits, not just efficiency; Beringer's portfolio logic should be framed as shared upside

---

## Context

Intro call with Dave Hinton on 2026-02-17 surfaced the following:

- VeraData is 18 months into a prescriptive analytics pivot led by Matt Kaiser
- Tom (first product hire, ex-Axiom) built the foundation but is not a scalable product leader
- No classic eng org — external dev firm is doing the building; team is data scientists and modelers
- Dave's framing: "You don't have products. You have analytics-driven services." This matters — it reframes the scope of the problem and positions product leadership as strategic, not just delivery
- VeraData is already in conversation with other fractional providers — timing is a real variable
- Pricing sensitivity flagged: standard fCPO rates may be too high for VeraData's size/model
- Dave is aligned and supportive but the real buy-in needs to come from Matt and Michael in this call

## Key Topics

1. **Matt's prescriptive analytics vision — get specific.** What does "always-on, multi-channel" actually mean for them? What does the product look like in 12 months? What's been built vs. what's imagined? Are there design specs, a roadmap, or is it still in Matt's head?

2. **Current product/tech org map.** How many data scientists? What's IT's role vs. the dev firm's? Where does Tom sit — is he an IC, a PM, a hybrid? What does the org chart actually look like today vs. what they need?

3. **External dev firm relationship — probe hard.** What's their scope? Fixed-price or T&M? How much has been spent? Is Matt/Michael happy with the output? What are the friction points? Is this a temporary bridge or a long-term model?

4. **Present the assessment offering.** 4-week, fixed-price engagement (~$40-60K CAD). Deliverable: a clear picture of what they have, what they need, and what model (fractional, full-time, hybrid) fits. Framing: "We'll tell you exactly what you need and whether fractional is even the right answer."

5. **Monthly retainer framing vs. daily rates.** Lead with outcome-based, monthly pricing — not day rates. Ties value to outcomes, not hours. Makes comparison to other fractionals harder. ~$15-25K/month retainer range depending on scope and team support.

6. **Differentiate from other fractionals.** Specific angles: (a) we bring a bench, not just one person; (b) PE track record — CTCT results are concrete (50% mobile conversion lift, best growth month in 11yrs, doubled activation in 4 months); (c) we've built and scaled product orgs inside PE-backed companies, we know how to operate inside their model.

## Questions

- "What does success look like 12 months from now for the prescriptive product — is it a product customers buy, or a capability that makes the services smarter?"
- "What's the biggest blocker right now — is it talent, tech, or clarity on what to build?"
- "How are you thinking about the balance between the agency business and the product business? Is the goal to productize the services, or to build a net-new product line?"
- "What's Tom's view on what he needs to succeed — has he told you what's blocking him?"
- "When you look at the external dev firm — are you happy with the pace and quality, or is that relationship up for reconsideration?"
- "You're talking to other fractional providers — what would make you feel confident you've found the right fit? What's the bar?"

## Strategic Play

Lead with the assessment as the low-commitment entry point. Do not pitch the fractional engagement directly — let the assessment do that work.

Frame it as: "Before we talk about whether fractional is right for you, let's make sure we understand what you actually have and what you need. Four weeks, fixed price, clear deliverable. You'll walk away with a roadmap and a recommendation — even if that recommendation isn't us."

This removes the sales pressure, builds trust with Michael (ops/cost-sensitive), and creates natural pull for the longer engagement. It also protects Vahid from walking into an ambiguous fractional scope with an org that's still figuring out what it needs.

On pricing sensitivity: do not discount the assessment. The fixed-price frame is already the concession on rate structure. Hold the $40-60K floor. If they push, offer phasing (two 2-week phases with a go/no-go) before discounting.

On competition: don't mention other fractionals first. If they bring it up, ask what they've heard and what's resonating. Then position against it specifically — not generically.

- Budget range acknowledged — $40-60K is not a blocker
- Dave Hinton gets a debrief signal that the call went well and momentum is real
- No discount offered; pricing held at assessment floor
