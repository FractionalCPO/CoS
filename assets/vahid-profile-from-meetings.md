## A. Working Style & Preferences

### How He Runs Meetings

**Agenda style:** Lightweight, action-oriented. No formal agendas for most meetings — standups follow a "what did you do / what are you doing / blockers" pattern. Strategic meetings (Courtney 1:1s, client discovery) are topic-driven but loosely structured. He doesn't over-prepare slides or decks — prefers live discussion with follow-up documentation.

**Decision-making in meetings:** Fast. He'll hear input, process quickly, and state a direction. Rarely defers decisions to a future meeting. When he does defer, it's because he's emotionally blocked (e.g., Ryan compensation conversation) not because he needs more data. He'll often reframe the problem mid-conversation — "the real question is..." pattern.

**Discovery calls with clients:** He leads with questions, listens deeply, then demonstrates expertise through specific frameworks and recommendations (Shape Up, PostHog, Sprint Zero). He doesn't pitch — he diagnoses. This is a strong pattern across Maestra, Finance of America, Gorilla, and Togal calls. He'll reference specific numbers ("90 products shipped, 8 exits, 200+ vetted CPOs") for credibility but keeps it casual.

**Internal meetings:** Direct, sometimes impatient. When meetings lack substance (Dec 8, Dec 10 CTCT standups — brief, canceled quickly), he doesn't force filler. He'll end a meeting in 6 minutes if there's nothing to discuss.

### Time Patterns

- **Daily check-ins with Ryan:** ~9:30am, 30 min Mon-Thu, 1hr Friday
- **Standups moved from 12pm to 4pm** (Feb 11) — 12pm was interrupting deep work blocks. Made optional same day.
- **L10 made optional** (Feb 11) — replaced by sales and bench reviews covering critical workstreams
- **Weekend/evening work:** Built LinkedIn automation system on weekends/evenings. Not uncommon for him to work on tooling outside business hours.
- **Client discovery calls:** Scattered across business hours, no strong time-of-day preference
- **Meeting duration:** Prefers short (20-30 min). Discovery calls run 45-60 min. Strategic sessions with Courtney run longer.
- **Meeting cadence preference:** He iterates cadences aggressively. Ryan check-ins evolved from 1hr daily to 30min Mon-Thu + 1hr Friday. Standups moved time. L10 made optional. He optimizes for minimum viable meetings.

### What He Delegates vs Keeps

**Delegates:**
- Inbox zero / calendar management (Ryan)
- LinkedIn outreach execution and message sending (Ryan, then Ali)
- Recruiting screening calls (Courtney — 10/week)
- Financial oversight, expense management, banking (Courtney)
- Corporate structure/legal mechanics (Courtney)
- Lead list building and CRM updates (Ryan)
- Scheduling, admin coordination, invoice templates (Ryan)
- Tool setup (HeyReach configuration, email domain warm-up)

**Keeps:**
- All client-facing strategy conversations and discovery calls
- Final approval on outreach messaging (hands-on editing every message)
- Partnership negotiations (Mauricio terms, JP separation)
- Hiring culture-fit assessment (final interviews)
- Product strategy and framework definition
- Sales infrastructure architecture (built LinkedIn posting system himself)
- Key relationship management (Vella, Brunetti, Meraj)
- Compensation decisions

**Pattern:** He delegates execution but retains messaging, strategy, and relationships. He's a bottleneck on anything requiring his voice or judgment — outreach copy, client positioning, partner terms.

### How He Gives Feedback

- **To team:** Indirect and delayed when it's negative. Admitted shame about business not running as planned prevented giving Ryan necessary feedback. This is a self-identified weakness.
- **To clients/prospects:** Direct and confident. Will tell a CEO their product spend is misallocated or recommend deprioritizing an entire segment (e-commerce at CTCT).
- **To partners:** Discusses concerns with Courtney first (proxy pattern). Ryan compensation was discussed extensively with Courtney before any conversation with Ryan. Ali termination happened after escalation, not proactive feedback.
- **On candidates:** Blunt and instinct-driven. "Douchebag psychopath vibes" (Garrett). "Solid B with concerns" (Mirage). Trusts gut on culture fit above credentials.
- **Style:** He's generous with praise when things are working ("emotionally regulated and proactive" about Ryan). But avoids hard conversations until forced. Shame is the blocker, not lack of clarity.

### What Frustrates Him

1. **Lack of authority as a consultant.** The CTCT engagement frustrated him because they had limited authority — wanted to be interim executives, not advisors. "Consultant label reduced influence."
2. **People not delivering.** Linda doing 1 interview vs Robbie's 31-32. Ali being unresponsive to clients. Strozak's ineffective presentation. He notices and judges quietly.
3. **Communication gaps.** Lee (CTCT CPO) had communication issues that directly frustrated the engagement.
4. **Overpaying for underwhelming output.** Ryan at $264K/year for EA-level work. Revelate net loss of $2K. Kieran's podcast at $5,600/month. He's allergic to bad ROI.
5. **Not posting on LinkedIn.** Missing a week of LinkedIn posts was "a source of stress." He knows it matters and it bothers him when he's not doing it.
6. **Scope creep without closure.** Pattern of wanting to finish loops. Documenting ideas "calms his mind." Unfinished projects drain him.
7. **Working with non-specialists.** Explicitly stated lesson: "Stop working with non-specialists regardless of friendship status."

### What Energizes Him

1. **Finishing things.** Website completion gave him energy and momentum. "Finishing projects is energizing."
2. **In-person networking.** Clockwork Meetup described as "energizing and productive."
3. **Building systems/tools.** LinkedIn automation, Claude agents for CRM, proposal GPT. He gets energy from creating leverage through technology.
4. **Client discovery calls.** He's in his element diagnosing product problems and recommending frameworks. The Maestra, Finance of America, and Gorilla calls show him fully engaged.
5. **Teaching/frameworks.** Shape Up, Sprint Zero, two-stage gate process, TF-IDF mental model — he loves sharing frameworks that create clarity.
6. **Progress signals.** 36 LinkedIn posts live, website shipped, 50 outreach messages sent. Concrete numbers of output matter.

## B. Hard Constraints & Boundaries

### Time Boundaries

- **Mornings are for deep work.** Moved standup from 12pm to 4pm to protect morning blocks. Daily Ryan check-in at 9:30am is the exception (quick tactical sync, not deep work).
- **Dominican Republic trip March 4.** Travel commitment with Elmira. Non-negotiable personal time.
- **Couples therapy on calendar** (Feb 6). Relationship maintenance is a priority.
- **Health appointments:** Active physio, chiropractic, osteopathy schedule. This is new and important to him — described as "significant positive change."

### Explicit Won't-Dos

- **Won't do engineering.** "Product management only — the opposite of a one-stop shop — no engineering services." Stated multiple times across discovery calls.
- **Won't sell below value.** Rejected podcast at $5,600/month. Structured pricing tiers ($4K audit to $70K interim) and holds to them.
- **Won't tolerate high ego.** "#1 hiring criterion: Low ego." Garrett rejected on vibes alone. This is non-negotiable.
- **Won't work with non-specialists regardless of friendship.** Explicit lesson learned from Ali and possibly others.

### Family Obligations

- **Elmira (partner):** Dominican Republic trip, couples therapy. Relationship gets real time allocation.
- **Ali (brother):** Terminated from business Jan 26. Emotionally difficult but boundary was set. "I don't want to be your employee" triggered the end.

### Financial Constraints (as of Feb 2026)

- **Zero revenue, ~$100K+ cash, 6-month runway.** This is existential context for every decision.
- **"Cash zero date" approaching.** Language suggests more urgency than the 6-month claim implies.
- **Won't maintain unsustainable burn.** Terminated Ryan ($22K/month) within 24 hours of Courtney sync where they agreed it was "financially irresponsible."

## C. Ryan's Role — What Donna Needs to Replace

### Ryan's Daily Routine

1. **Morning check-in with Vahid (~9:30am):** Report yesterday's work, share today's MIT, get Vahid's priorities. 30 min Mon-Thu, 1hr Friday.
2. **Inbox management:** LinkedIn inbox zero (starring messages expecting replies, archiving completed), email triage.
3. **Calendar management:** Scheduling, rescheduling, coordination.
4. **Outreach execution:** Sending customized messages to Vector site visitors (~60 leads), LinkedIn outreach copy, lead list maintenance.
5. **Admin tasks:** Invoice templates, recruiting scheduling, account separation docs, CRM updates in Notion.
6. **Content support:** LinkedIn company page revamp, outreach message refinement (Vahid edits, Ryan executes).
7. **Research:** Lead research, competitor analysis, checking LinkedIn connections for conflicts, CTCT competitor strategy.

### Weekly Cadence with Vahid

| Day | Meeting | Duration | Purpose |
|-----|---------|----------|---------|
| Mon-Thu | Daily check-in | 30 min | Morning tactical sync |
| Friday | 1:1 | 1 hour | Strategic, personal, week recap/planning |
| As needed | Daily wrap | Varies | End-of-day sync on progress |

### What Vahid Delegated to Ryan Specifically

- **LinkedIn inbox zero** — starring, archiving, flagging
- **Vector site visitor outreach** — 60 customized messages from 200+ visitors
- **Lead list building** — reconciling Ali's and Ryan's lists, segmenting by role
- **Outreach copy editing** — Ryan drafted, Vahid refined
- **HeyReach/ALO management** — took over from Ali post-termination
- **Email infrastructure** — Instantly setup, 5 burner domains
- **FGTM separation** — removing Ali's access, creating transition docs
- **Recruiting coordination** — scheduling interviews, follow-ups
- **Mark Kirschner papering** — partnership documentation
- **CTCT competitor research** — checking LinkedIn connections, researching companies
- **CRM/Notion updates** — pipeline, marketing roadmap
- **Expense/admin** — credit card reorg, invoice templates
- **Personal admin** — DR trip e-ticket form, Troy CPA access setup
- **Content** — LinkedIn company page, Fiverr/Upwork copywriter hire

### What Vahid Wanted Ryan to Do But Didn't Get

- **True Chief of Staff level thinking.** Ryan was characterized as "EA-level (inbox, calendar, small tasks) rather than Chief of Staff." The title didn't match the output.
- **Proactive strategic input.** Ryan was "emotionally regulated and proactive" but the proactivity was on task execution, not strategic thinking.
- **Independent decision-making.** Ryan required "frequent feedback" — couldn't operate autonomously at the CoS level.
- **Workload self-management.** Ryan had "tendency to overcommit" — agreed to carve out half his day for unexpected tasks. Morning walks recommended to prevent burnout.

### Onboarding Pattern (First Ryan Calls)

- Started with daily 1-hour check-ins, iterated down to 30 min Mon-Thu + 1hr Friday
- Heavy context transfer: current clients, pipeline, team dynamics, tool access
- Ryan's first tasks were operational: inbox, calendar, scheduling
- Gradually expanded to outreach, content, research
- The cadence was constantly tuned — Vahid actively experiments with meeting formats

### Key Lesson for Donna

Ryan was $264K/year for work that was fundamentally EA-level. Donna needs to:
1. Handle all the EA work (inbox, calendar, scheduling, admin) at near-zero marginal cost
2. Add the strategic layer Ryan couldn't — synthesize across inputs, surface patterns, make recommendations
3. Never require "frequent feedback" — operate autonomously with judgment
4. Close loops without being told — the anti-Ryan

## D. Relationship Dynamics

### Courtney Cunningham (Partner)

**Dynamic:** Strategic ally and operational counterweight. Vahid uses Courtney as a sounding board before hard decisions (Ryan compensation, Mauricio terms, Ali termination). She provides the financial reality check he sometimes avoids.

**Communication:** Weekly 1:1, plus ad-hoc. He's direct with her. They discuss compensation, partnership terms, and personnel issues openly — including admitting his own shame and emotional blocks.

**Roles:** Vahid = sales, strategy, client relationships. Courtney = financial oversight, recruiting, operations. "Package deal" for client engagements. She's the one doing 10 recruiting calls/week while he focuses on pipeline.

**Tension:** External advisors "would likely recommend removing one of Courtney/Ryan" — too similar for company size. This was acknowledged but not resolved before Ryan's termination.

### Mauricio Idarraga (Partner)

**Dynamic:** Respected but complicated. Mauricio runs growth/experiments independently and well (ran CTCT experiments, conducted growth assessments). But he's also full-time at CTCT, creating bandwidth concerns.

**Negotiation urgency:** "Must happen before leads convert" — Vahid knows Mauricio will fight harder for a bigger share once revenue is visible. The 2+5 points structure was agreed with Courtney, not yet with Mauricio.

**Role:** Advisor partner with weekly check-ins. Three buckets: growth assessment tool, sales call appearances, coach/overseer for product growth. Not day-to-day operations.

### JP Moya (Departed)

**Dynamic:** Former core strategy partner. They divided workstreams — JP handled program ownership, PLG, M&A; Vahid handled product partnership, CPO role. Co-presented to Frank Vella and CTCT leadership.

**Departure:** Clean but costly. Full severance by Feb 1. LLC dissolution. Release agreement. "Drain accounts and completely sever ties." Suggests the split was not amicable but handled professionally.

**Pattern:** Partnership tested with a "Darwinian" approach (one project at a time), escalated through CTCT, then dissolved. Vahid learned from this — now more cautious about partnership structures.

### Ali Jozi (Brother, Terminated)

**Dynamic:** Family working relationship that ended badly. Ali was running LinkedIn outreach but said "I don't want to be your employee" during a GTM sync. Terminated by end of week.

**Lesson stated explicitly:** "Stop working with non-specialists regardless of friendship status." This extends beyond Ali to a general principle about mixing personal relationships with business.

**Emotional impact:** Likely significant but not dwelt on in meetings. Vahid moved quickly to transition Ali's responsibilities to Ryan.

### Key External Relationships

- **Frank Vella (CTCT CEO):** Top referral priority. Vahid invested heavily in this relationship — multiple strategy sessions, exec-level trust. Now leveraging for referrals post-engagement. "CTCT door now closed, so Vella referrals are critical."
- **Meraj:** Fellow Persian-background product leader. Good personal chemistry, "humble, curious, hungry" framework resonated. Potential bench talent and kindred spirit.
- **Mark Kirschner:** Former CTCT fCMO, being papered as potential partner. Intro'd Behringer Capital. Pattern of getting excited then dropping off.
- **Natasha:** Outside advisor consulted for compensation structure validation. Trusted external perspective.

---

## E. Decision Patterns

### Speed & Style

**Fast by default.** Vahid makes most decisions quickly — within a single meeting or conversation. He'll process input, reframe the problem, and state a direction. Examples:
- Ali terminated within days of the conflict
- Ryan terminated within 24 hours of Courtney sync
- Podcast frozen in one conversation
- Standup time and L10 format changed same day (Feb 11)
- CTCT competitor strategy adopted immediately after advisor validation (Feb 13)

**Slow when emotionally blocked.** The Ryan compensation conversation was delayed for weeks because of shame. The Mauricio negotiation was flagged as "URGENT" multiple times but kept getting deferred. Pattern: when the decision involves a difficult personal conversation, he delays.

### Frameworks Referenced

1. **Shape Up** (Basecamp) — appetite-based, 6-week cycles, cooldown. Referenced in Maestra discovery, Ryan sales planning.
2. **"Now, Next, Later"** — prioritization model for marketing roadmap.
3. **Sprint Zero** — market research and strategy before building. Used in Togal proposal.
4. **Two-stage gate process** — Stage 1: proceed to discovery, Stage 2: proceed to delivery. Implemented at CTCT.
5. **TF-IDF mental model** — for identifying core anchors in outreach messaging.
6. **Continuous Discovery Habits** (Teresa Torres book) — recommended to Maestra.
7. **Essentialism** — referenced in CLAUDE.md, drives his "reduce, clarify, decide" posture.
8. **Radical Candor** — referenced in CLAUDE.md but notably struggles with the "caring personally + challenging directly" balance (Ryan situation).
9. **EOS/L10** — used then made optional. Pragmatic about frameworks — adopts and discards based on utility.
10. **"Humble, curious, hungry"** — Meraj's framework that resonated as hiring criteria.

### When He Seeks Input vs Decides Alone

**Seeks input:**
- Compensation/partnership terms → Courtney first, then Natasha for outside validation
- Negotiation strategy → Massey (external advisor for CTCT deal)
- Candidate culture fit → Courtney's read (Garrett "douchebag vibes" was Courtney's assessment)
- Financial decisions → Courtney (runway, expense review, vendor audit)
- CTCT competitor strategy → "Multiple advisors confirmed approach"

**Decides alone:**
- Hiring criteria (#1 = low ego, non-negotiable)
- Product strategy and frameworks (Shape Up, two-stage gate, etc.)
- Outreach messaging and positioning
- Tool/system architecture (LinkedIn automation, Claude agents, website)
- Meeting cadence changes (standup time, L10 optional)
- Terminations (executes fast once decided)

**Pattern:** He seeks input on money and people dynamics. He decides alone on strategy, messaging, and systems. When he asks for input, he's usually looking for validation, not direction — the decision is often already formed.

## F. Behavioral Summary for CLAUDE.md

### Do This

- Surface the top 1-3 priorities. He thinks in "reduce, clarify, decide."
- Close loops. Unfinished items drain him. Track and push to completion.
- Be direct about financial reality. He respects the hard truth even when it's uncomfortable.
- Propose specific actions, not options. He decides fast when presented with a recommendation.
- Protect his mornings for deep work. Don't schedule anything before 10am if avoidable.
- Flag when he's avoiding a hard conversation. The Ryan pattern will repeat. Name it early.
- Match his framework language: Shape Up, appetite, sprint zero, now/next/later.
- Keep outreach copy tight. He obsesses over conciseness — two lines max.

### Don't Do This

- Don't present neutral summaries. He wants recommendations.
- Don't expand scope without stating it. He hates creep.
- Don't schedule meetings that could be async. He actively reduces meeting load.
- Don't assume he'll read long documents. Structure with headers, bullets, one-liners.
- Don't be precious about frameworks. He adopts and discards them pragmatically.
- Don't soft-pedal bad news. He admitted shame blocks him — external directness helps him overcome it.

### Emotional Landscape

- **Shame** is his primary blocker. It prevented Ryan feedback, may prevent other hard conversations.
- **Completion** is his primary energizer. Ship things. Mark things done.
- **Isolation** is a risk. He's founder-lonely. Networking events and Meraj-type connections energize him.
- **Control** over messaging and positioning matters deeply. He edits every outreach message. Don't send anything without his voice.
