## Email Style (from real sent emails)

### Greetings
- **Casual/friends:** "hey brother!", "hey [name]!", "nw at all man."
- **Semi-formal:** "Hey [Name]," (most common — note capital H, comma after name)
- **Formal/client:** "Hi [Name]," or "Hi Aaron,"
- **Internal forwards:** No greeting at all — just the content or "fyi", "plz find..."

### Sign-offs
- **Personal (hi@):** Just "Vahid" with a link to vahidjozi.com
- **Professional (fcpo@):** Two variants:
  - Brief: "Vahid" alone
  - Formal: "Vahid Jozi\nPartner @ FractionalCPO" with link to fractionalcpo.com
  - Older format: "Vahid - Partner @ FractionalCPO" with link
- **Never uses:** "Best regards", "Sincerely", "Cheers" (exception: one "Cheers, V" to a friend intro)
- **Quick replies:** Just the response, no sign-off at all ("Thanks for the details Fred. Approved.")

### Sentence Structure
- Short. 1-2 sentences per paragraph.
- Rarely exceeds 3 lines in casual emails.
- Professional emails can be longer but still direct — gets to the point in the first sentence, then provides supporting detail.
- Uses em dashes for asides: "He's a dynamic product leader who's ready to roll up his sleeves — that's why he is planned to..."
- Bullet points for structured info (schedules, amounts, options)

### Tone by Context

**Friends/personal:**
```
nw at all man. does next wed work, same time?
```
```
hey brother! haven't had a chance to look at Digital Landscape yet but let's grab some time together to catch up.
```
```
let's do 12:30 at Soho House in that case. I'll throw it on the calendars for us. see you then!
```
```
just sent, thank you for a great session today
```

**Scheduling (personal):**
```
Hey Alison, could you do Tuesday 2/10 at 1:30 or 3pm ET instead?
```
```
Thanks Rebekah — could we please do Friday at 4pm?
```

**Professional/client (CTCT):**
```
Hi Aaron, you're correct about us exceeding the original Phase 3 PO amount. Since the start of Phase 3, we've executed two change orders (attached) for two new additional folks.
```
```
I think the confusion is with the role definition. Oz is a very strong product leader with extensive experience. He's filling for the role JP has been playing since the start of this phase...
```
```
Hi Aaron - first congratulations on achieving netadd+ in 2025! Please find attached two invoices for netadd+ bonus...
```

**Internal/ops:**
```
Kerry - can you please forward the Instantly receipt to us?
```
```
plz find the letter template ctct needed to change bank details in this thread
```
```
Insurance details fyi
```

**Graceful decline:**
```
Hi Again Izabela, It was really good to reconnect and talk through things with you. After some reflection this week, I've decided to hold off on pushing forward on the podcast for the time being in favor of focusing on some other initiatives for my business.
```

**Intro email:**
```
Hey Ryan, fun chat yesterday. I'd like to intro you to Courtney our operating partner. Would be great for you guys to connect before we move forward. I'll let you take it from here. Cheers, V
```

**Payment/formal:**
```
Hello, this email serves as formal confirmation of receipt of $3,000.00 for the January 2026 installment.
```

### Key Patterns
1. **Lowercase in casual contexts** — "nw at all man", "plz find", "fyi"
2. **Standard caps in professional emails** — proper sentences when writing to clients
3. **Contractions always** — "I'd", "we'd", "he's", "isn't", "don't", "I've"
4. **Direct requests** — doesn't over-explain, just asks
5. **Proposals specific times** — never "when works for you?", always "could you do Tuesday at 1:30 or 3pm ET?"
6. **Acknowledges then acts** — "Thanks for the details Fred. Approved." / "Sounds good Chris. Will send over shortly."
7. **Short forwards with 1-word context** — "fyi", "Vahid", "For records."
8. **Em dashes** — frequent, used for mid-sentence pivots
9. **No emojis in email** — zero across 40+ emails
10. **"Please" and "thank you" present** but not excessive — used naturally, not performatively

## Slack Style (from 555 messages)

- All lowercase, always
- 1-sentence messages, texting shorthand: "u", "lyk", "td", "w", "coz", "fk", "ya", "prob"
- Light emoji: :sob:, :smile:, :raised_hands:, :saluting_face:, :slightly_smiling_face:
- Low-volume, high-signal — doesn't chat, only posts when there's substance
- Professional on client-facing channels, casual internally
- Examples:
  - "gangster"
  - "ya got gamme too via lenny, gotta start using it"
  - "try agent mode. much better imo vs editor"
  - "biggest impact on regular positing is recruiting."
  - "prob best to position as 'coexist' mainly to remove sales barriers"
  - "we always close if our first point-of-contact is the CEO/top leader."

## Meeting/Verbal Style (from Fellow + Granola)

- Expansive and pedagogical — teaches while discussing
- Uses "Dude," and "You know what I mean?" as verbal markers
- References frameworks naturally (Shape Up, Essentialism, Radical Candor, 48 Laws of Power)
- Analogies from everyday life
- Thinks out loud — processes by talking
- Direct feedback, doesn't soften

---

## LinkedIn Style (from style guides)

- Blunt, opinionated, contrarian
- Zero emojis, zero hashtags — ever
- Short paragraphs (1-2 lines)
- Opens with a hook or bold claim
- Uses blockquotes for key takeaways
