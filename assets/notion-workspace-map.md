# Notion Workspace Map
**Generated:** 2026-02-20
**Method:** 16 keyword searches + targeted page/database fetches
**Scope:** Everything accessible to the Notion MCP connector (claude_ai_Notion)

---

## CRITICAL FINDING: No "Vivo" Workspace

The Notion MCP integration has **zero access** to any workspace named "Vivo," "Personal," "Life," "Health," "Journal," "Habit," or "Goal." Every single result across all 16 searches points exclusively to FractionalCPO business content. The integration is scoped to the **FractionalCPO Notion workspace only** — either Vivo lives in a separate Notion account/workspace that hasn't been connected, or it doesn't exist yet.

---

## Workspace: FractionalCPO

All content is under a single Notion workspace associated with the FractionalCPO business. There are **5 top-level sections** (pages with no parent) and a cluster of older/legacy pages from 2024.

## WHAT THE CONNECTOR CANNOT SEE

Based on exhaustive search across 16 terms including "Vivo", "Personal", "Life", "Health", "Finance" (personal), "Journal", "Habit", "Goal":

- **No personal workspace** (Vivo or otherwise)
- **No personal finance tracking**
- **No journal or habit tracker**
- **No personal goal tracking**
- **No health/fitness database**
- **No calendar or events database**
- **No second Notion workspace of any kind**

The connector is scoped **exclusively to the FractionalCPO business workspace**. If Vivo exists, it is either:
1. A separate Notion account (different email login)
2. A workspace the connector has not been granted access to
3. Not yet created
