## 8. fCPO Opportunity Assessment

### Tier 1 — Strongest Fit
1. **Dig Insights** — Services-to-SaaS transition with Upsiide platform. Founders stepping back. Classic fCPO engagement: product strategy, roadmap, SaaS scaling, pricing/packaging.
2. **Northern Commerce** — Rapid M&A integration (3 companies merging). Needs unified product/service strategy, potential platform play. New CEO (Beringer operating partner) likely receptive to outside product expertise.
3. **Bold Orange** — Post-acquisition growth phase. CX agency with tech implementation capabilities. Opportunity to productize methodologies and build proprietary tools.

### Tier 2 — Moderate Fit
4. **VeraData** — Strong data/AI platform with potential to expand self-serve capabilities. Founder-led, so engagement would need to complement existing vision.
5. **Inman** — Media platform that could benefit from product strategy around subscriptions, AI personalization, community products.

### Tier 3 — Lower Fit
6. **Benzinga** — Large enough to likely have in-house product leadership. Possible advisory role around AI product strategy.

## 9. Approach Strategy

**Entry point:** Dave Hinton (Operating Partner, existing contact).

**Pitch angle:** Beringer's portfolio has several companies in the services-to-platform transition (Dig Insights, Northern Commerce, Bold Orange). This is exactly where fCPO adds the most value — helping companies that have domain expertise and customer relationships but need product strategy to build scalable, recurring-revenue products.

**Specific talking points for Dave:**
- Dig Insights' Upsiide platform needs product leadership with the founders stepping back
- Northern Commerce is integrating 3 acquisitions and needs unified product strategy
- Bold Orange is post-acquisition and ready for the next growth phase
- Pattern: Beringer's value creation playbook could include fCPO as a repeatable operating lever across portfolio

**Ask:** Introduction to portfolio company CEOs (Paul Gaudette at Dig, Mark Kelley at Northern, Margaret Murphy at Bold Orange) or to Perry/Gil/Lu for a portfolio-wide conversation.
