## Participant Profiles

**Michael Kulpinsky (COO, VeraData)** — PE-placed operational leader. Career in large-scale print/direct mail production (Moore Wallace, RR Donnelley, Innovairre). Joined post-Beringer acquisition ~2022. Classic PE COO: process, integration, cost discipline. Currently integrating Faircom and New River acquisitions. Not a product person — wants throughput, ROI, accountability. Impatient; get to the point fast. In discovery call, focused on $3M/FTE target, EBITDA growth, and speed of transformation. His line: "not happy standing still."

**Matt Kaiser (CSO, VeraData)** — 15+ year VeraData veteran, original leadership team alongside CEO Peterman. Architect of the prescriptive analytics pivot. Strategy brain — cares about the "why" and "what next." Skeptical of legacy nonprofit analytics; wants to move from descriptive data to prescriptive decision support. In discovery, asked about the fCPO exec model and wanted to understand how fractional differs from consulting. His line: wants "tech/AI innovation."

**Dave Hinton (Strategic Advisor, Beringer Capital)** — 20+ years in digital marketing/adtech leadership. Microsoft (8 yrs), co-founded Acerno (acquired by Akamai), CEO of Trueffect, currently Strategic Advisor at Attently. Deep expertise in audience targeting, programmatic, AI/ML in advertising. Manages 3 portfolio companies at Beringer at 3:1 ratio. He is the champion who introduced fCPO to this opportunity. Aligned and supportive. His role: multi-threaded advisor who wants to see velocity. Email: dhinton@beringercapital.com.

**Courtney Cunningham (COO, Crowdlinker / fCPO Operating Partner)** — Co-leads all client engagements with Vahid. Product ops and org-building background. Was on the discovery call and the prep session. Her analysis: VeraData's core issue is product strategy, not execution — it's a thinking bottleneck, not a doing bottleneck. The three assessment pillars she identified: (1) product strategy, (2) go-to-market strategy, (3) execution strategy.

## Key Context

**What happened in discovery (2/19):**
- Strong 60-min call. Mike, Matt, Dave all attended. Courtney and Vahid from fCPO.
- VeraData confirmed they are in early infancy of product dev — 1 product hire (Tom, 18 months), recently engaged external dev firm.
- 18 months of translating concepts into requirements, use cases, roadmaps. Now need to accelerate.
- They want to "multi-thread" multiple projects concurrently, "happy to fall down, not happy standing still."
- Targeting multibillion-dollar valuation over 3-5 years. Current PE sponsor (Beringer) is a stepping stone — they expect to change sponsors as enterprise value grows.
- Revenue per FTE: $1.5M today, goal is $3M/FTE (Google/Meta range).
- 18 years of consistent EBITDA growth, never a down year.
- Three future revenue streams: distribution channels, data monetization, mass-market subscription.
- Biggest risk: lack of velocity/momentum. Need someone who can "put points on the board" quickly.
- Organizational transformation risk: shifting from service-based to tech-driven org.
- Majority of data science/AI/ML sits in Eastern Europe (offshore team). Cultural fit + high EQ required.
- NDA executed 2/19.
- Agreed next steps from discovery: fCPO to provide candidate profiles, engagement strategy, financials, sample agreement, and references.

**What happened since discovery (2/19-2/23):**
- Vahid & Courtney 1:1 (2/23) finalized proposal details.
- Assessment priced at $54K (4 weeks active + 2 week buffer).
- Engagement rate: $350/hr ($2,450/day), ~$509K annually — 46% less than CtCt rate.
- Candidate selected: Thais (startup org-builder, knows Shape Up, available now, charges ~$200/hr). Shane ruled out — he thrives in no-structure, but VeraData needs someone to build structure from scratch.
- Eastern European candidate also surfaced for consideration.
- Strategy: treat VeraData as entry point to lock up Beringer's larger portfolio companies (especially Clear Lake). Accept lower margins to become "fractional on record" for Beringer.
- Proposal format: text-based Notion memo, not a slide deck — differentiate from traditional consultants.

## Our Position

**What we're proposing:**
1. **Assessment** — $54K, 6 weeks (4 active + 2 buffer)
   - Week 1-2: Audit, discovery, data analysis
   - Week 3: Insight verification, synthesis
   - Week 4: Review findings with client, execution planning, fCPO recruiting
   - Week 5-6: Buffer, begin collaboration
2. **Ongoing engagement** — $350/hr ($2,450/day), ~$42K/month
3. **Lead candidate:** Thais — VP-level product leader with startup org-building experience

**What we need from the client:**
- Designated project sponsor (CEO/ELT)
- Designated ELT main contact
- Formal intro to internal team
- Access to data systems
- Exposure to sales & customer management process
- Customer call recordings + ability to conduct new customer discovery calls
- Access to existing strategic/market/customer/product artifacts
- Access to Beringer investment memo

**Our value prop (use this line):**
"FractionalCPO de-risks the product investment you've already committed to — we're not a cost, we are insurance against building the wrong thing."

## Talking Points

1. **Open with momentum.** Reference the energy from the discovery call. "We left that conversation more excited about this than any engagement in our pipeline. Here's what we've put together." Signal that you took it seriously and moved fast.

2. **Present the assessment as the entry point, not a pitch.** Frame: "Before we deploy anyone, we need 4 weeks to understand what you actually have, validate what you need, and build the right action plan. This isn't consultant theater — it's how we de-risk the entire engagement for both sides."

3. **Address their stated pain: velocity.** Mike's #1 concern is speed. Position the assessment as accelerating their timeline, not adding steps. "Every week without product leadership clarity is a week of opportunity cost. The assessment compresses 6 months of fumbling into 4 weeks of structured insight."

4. **Name the candidate profile without overselling.** "We've identified a strong lead candidate — VP-level product leader with experience standing up product orgs from scratch in startup environments. She's available now, which matters given your 18-month window. We'll share her full profile as part of the proposal."

5. **Hit the Beringer portfolio angle gently.** Don't pitch it as "we want your whole portfolio." Instead: "We understand Beringer's model and how value creation works across portfolio companies. The assessment deliverable will be structured so it's useful not just for VeraData but as a template for how product leadership gaps get addressed across the portfolio."

6. **Pricing: lead with the $54K assessment.** Don't volunteer the full engagement rate unprompted. If they ask, frame as $2,450/day — per-day basis avoids hourly scrutiny. If they need the annual number, $509K is 46% less than CtCt. Benchmark: a CPO hire would cost $300-435K in year one before any work happens, plus 6 quarters to know if they're working.

7. **Close on a specific next step.** "We'd like to send you the full proposal this week — assessment scope, timeline, team, and pricing. Can we schedule a follow-up for [specific date] to review it together and make a decision?" Don't leave without a date.

## Watch For

- **Mike's body language on pricing.** He's the cost-sensitive one. If he leans back or goes quiet when numbers come up, he's doing math. Pause and let him ask questions — don't fill the silence with justification.

- **Matt may want to go deeper on methodology.** He's the strategy brain. If he starts asking "how" questions about the assessment process, that's a buy signal — he's imagining himself in the engagement. Feed it with specifics (who you'll interview, what data you'll analyze, what the deliverable looks like).

- **Dave is the facilitator, not the decision-maker.** He'll nod and smooth things over. Don't over-index on his approval — focus on earning Matt's intellectual buy-in and Mike's ROI conviction. Dave's job is to make sure this gets to a yes.

- **"We need to loop in Tom / the CEO."** This is likely — they haven't brought CEO Michael Peterman or SPM Tom Hutchison into the conversation yet. If this comes up, it's not a stall, it's a real next step. Offer to present to them directly: "We'd love to do a short session with Tom and Michael P. to get their perspective. That's actually part of how we'd kick off the assessment."

- **Tension between service business and product ambition.** They are a service company trying to become a product company. If anyone signals hesitation about how the transition affects current revenue or team roles, acknowledge it directly: "That tension is exactly what the assessment is designed to address. We've seen this pattern — the orgs that navigate it well are the ones that name it early."

- **Eastern European team dynamics.** Half the team is offshore in Ukraine. If cultural fit or communication comes up, lean in: "Our lead candidate has high EQ and experience working across distributed teams. That's a non-negotiable for us in candidate selection."

- **Competitive pressure.** VeraData was talking to other fractional providers. If they mention alternatives, ask what resonated and position against it specifically. Don't be defensive — be curious.
