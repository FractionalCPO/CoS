## 1. Current State of Business (as of Feb 2026)

**FractionalCPO is in pre-revenue build mode.** The company has zero revenue as of mid-February 2026. The previous anchor client (Constant Contact / CTCT) engagement has wound down. The team is now fully focused on building sales infrastructure, recruiting bench talent, and generating pipeline.

- **Revenue goal for 2026:** $4M from 3 large client accounts (up from ~$2M last year)
- **Runway:** ~6 months through July 2026 (~$100K+ in the bank, per Courtney's estimates)
- **Team size target:** ~10 people across 3 client accounts
- **Corporate transition:** Moving from US LLC (being dissolved, JP separation) to Canadian corporation
- **Vahid's time allocation:** ~70% on sales infrastructure/tooling (LinkedIn automation, website, lead lists), ~20% on recruiting calls, ~10% on partnership/operations

## 2. Pipeline Details

### Active Prospects

| Prospect | Status | Source | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Trader (Bowden)** | VP wants to reorg, meeting CEO Feb 12 or 19 | Existing relationship | Dedicated #fcpo-Trader Slack channel. Slow-rolling but active. |
| **Behringer Capital** | Intro via Mark Kirschner (ex-CTCT fCMO) | Warm referral | Pattern: gets excited, drops off due to internal issues, comes back. Dave meeting pending. Vahid to analyze portfolio companies. |
| **Daniel Burns / Main+Main** | New lead, real estate dev firm | Inbound | Wants help using AI in operations. Potential connection to Coastal Construction (Patrick Murphy). Not yet in CRM. |
| **Coastal Construction** | Patrick Murphy asked for follow-up around now | Previous contact | Will add to CRM as prospect. Ryan holding off until Vahid speaks with Daniel Burns to leverage both. |
| **Nikhil (fCMO)** | Call completed Feb 10 | Network | Assessment one-pager for Tampa Bay Times due by Feb 16. |
| **Vella** | Top priority referral source | Former CTCT relationship | Currently in Toronto dealing with death in family. Plan: dinner, secure referral agreement. CTCT door now closed, so Vella referrals are critical. |
| **Brunetti / Constant Contact** | Consulting opportunity evaluated | Existing relationship | Vahid sees leadership gap in execution. Reached out to demonstrate understanding of challenges. Communication challenges noted. NOT being pursued as a close -- instead targeting CTCT competitors. |
| **Reforge partnership** | Reactivation pending | Previous relationship | Backed by Insight Partners. Ajay Gandhi (EVP Onsite) visited fractionalcpo.com. Need collateral (one-pager + case study) before re-engaging. Timeline: end of Feb once website content pages ready. |
| **Finance of America** | Reengagement | Previous contact | Ryan checking with Vahid's contact about experience before sending draft to Kristen. |
| **CTCT Competitors** | NEW STRATEGIC DIRECTION | Research phase | MSA is explicitly non-exclusive. Vahid has maximum leverage with competitors right now. Multiple advisors confirmed approach. Researching competitors, checking LinkedIn connections to avoid drama. |

### Outreach Infrastructure

- **Automated LinkedIn Outreach (ALO):** HeyReach fully set up and billing configured. Three LinkedIn profiles (Heather/VP 17% acceptance, Nadia/Director 10%, Thea 3.4%). ~45 connection requests/day across 3 profiles. Sales Nav was a blocker but being resolved.
- **Vector Site Visitors:** Ryan messaging ~60 leads (narrowed from 200+). ~40% are better suited as recruiting candidates. ~50 custom-tailored messages sent.
- **LinkedIn Posting:** Automation system complete. 36 posts scheduled and live. Readwise integration for tagged content.
- **Email Infrastructure:** Instantly configured with 5 burner domains warming up. Protecting main fractionalcpo.com domain.
- **Apollo:** Being considered for lead enrichment at low cost.
- **Lead Lists:** Two existing lists (Ali's and Ryan's) need reconciliation. Segmented by role: CPOs/product leaders separate from C-suite.

### Sales Funnel Targets (set Feb 3)

- **By Feb 28:** 5+ verified sales opportunities (Vahid has validated opportunity in person, budget + urgency confirmed)
- **By Mar 31:** At least 1 deal in negotiation stage (discussing terms of engagement)
- **Channels:** ALO (automated LinkedIn), MLO (manual LinkedIn), Referrals, Helpful Podcast (frozen), LinkedIn posting/engagement, Substack (contrarianproduct.com)

## 3. Courtney Conversations

### Recurring Meetings
- **Weekly 1:1** (Vahid & Courtney)
- **Weekly Bench + Sales Review** (Vahid, Courtney, Ryan)
- **Daily Stand-Up** (full team -- moved from 12pm to ~4pm to optimize for uninterrupted work blocks)

### Key Topics with Courtney

**Financial Planning & Runway (Jan 19 1:1):**
- Six-month financial runway through July 2026
- Reviewed vendor/subscription expenses -- found unexpectedly high charges, net loss of ~$2K on Revelate project
- Developed contingency plans including expense reductions across subscriptions

**Ryan's Compensation (Jan 19 1:1 + Feb 11 sync):**
- Ryan currently at $22K/month (~$264K annually) -- described as "financially irresponsible" given zero revenue
- Original justification (Vahid joining CTCT) no longer applies
- Decision: maintain current salary through end of Q1, then reassess
- Proposed restructure: reduce to $11K/month with ~5% profit share
- Ryan's role characterized as EA-level (inbox management, calendar, small tasks) rather than Chief of Staff
- Ryan described as "emotionally regulated and proactive" -- net positive but requiring frequent feedback
- Courtney and Ryan viewed as "too similar for the size of company" to both command high compensation
- External advisors would likely recommend removing one of the two similar ops roles
- Vahid admitted shame about business not running as planned is preventing him from giving Ryan necessary feedback

**Mauricio (Mori) Partnership (Feb 11 sync):**
- Concerns about Mori's bandwidth given full-time CTCT employment
- Negotiation with Mori is URGENT -- must happen before leads convert to opportunities (he'll fight harder for bigger share once revenue visible)
- Three defined responsibility buckets: (1) growth assessment tool, (2) sales call appearances, (3) coach/overseer for product growth
- Agreed: advisor partner with weekly check-ins
- Compensation: 2 points permanent for sales support + ~5 additional initiative-specific points for active growth assessment accounts
- Natasha to be consulted for outside opinion on structures

**Corporate Structure (multiple meetings):**
- Canadian corporation being set up (Oct 31 fiscal year end)
- Vahid & Courtney did Canadian corp setup session Jan 16 (Owner and Ven banking)

- New VEN business bank account initiated
- Re-sign MSA with Constant Contact via new Canadian corp
- RBC business bank account being closed
- Chart of accounts being set up for new business
- 1099 tax filing completed, W8 forms kept for international contractors

**Recruiting (ongoing):**
- Courtney conducting ~10 recruiting calls/week from Slack communities (Lenny's newsletter generated 30 responses; Reforge Slack "completely dead")
- Signed up for LinkedIn Recruiter Lite (2-month discount)
- Sourcing Canadian candidates for growth/product ops roles
- Posting in: Mind the Product, True North CTO, Chat PRD, Product School Slack communities
- Identified candidates Vella was interviewing when he hired Lee (including CEO of Glassdoor) as prospects
- All candidates so far from US -- Courtney raising affordability concerns but noting market conditions (high unemployment) may enable hiring senior talent at lower rates

**Talent Evaluation Framework:**
- 1-4 scoring system: 2 = needs hard 90-minute interview, 3 = expected to do well, 4 = focus on working relationship
- Ideal profile: former VPs/leaders who stepped back to IC roles for execution/learning
- Building AI-powered candidate evaluation system (recordings + notes through Cursor for summaries)
- In-person session planned to define cultural traits framework
- Identified SAFE framework as a target market (companies dissatisfied with overly prescribed process)

**Partnership Distribution Model (Jan 19):**
- Target: $4M revenue from 3 large accounts
- Defined management split: Vahid oversees sales, Courtney handles financial oversight
- Evaluated Mirage as potential hire (rated "solid B" with concerns)

## 4. Ryan Conversations

### Daily Check-in Pattern
Ryan and Vahid have daily check-ins (morning ~9:30am) plus occasional wraps. Pattern:
- Ryan reports yesterday's work and today's MIT (Most Important Task)
- Vahid shares his calendar/priorities
- Quick tactical decisions

### Ryan's Core Work
- **Inbox/Calendar Management:** Managing Vahid's LinkedIn inbox (inbox zero), email, calendar
- **Outreach Execution:** Vector site visitor messaging, LinkedIn outreach copy editing, lead list building
- **Admin/Coordination:** Recruiting scheduling, mark Kirschner papering, invoice templates, Ali/fGTM separation
- **Content:** LinkedIn company page revamp, outreach message refinement

### Key Ryan Discussions

**Outreach Strategy (multiple):**
- Flipped prioritization: messaging outreach FIRST, then content development
- Website visitor tracking: outreach appears as "serendipitous/cold" rather than revealing tracking
- LinkedIn inbox management: starring messages expecting replies, archiving completed conversations
- Outreach message refinement: concise two-line messages, TF-IDF mental model for core anchors
- Debated Vahid's title in signatures: testing removal entirely ("Vahid Fractional CPO") vs partner/CEO
- PE-specific jargon like "turnaround" avoided (implies cutting teams); emphasis on "revenue growth through product leadership"

**Sales Infrastructure (Feb 6 1:1):**
- Marketing roadmap in Notion: website v1 -> LinkedIn posting -> ALO -> website content -> LinkedIn engagement
- "Now, Next, Later" prioritization model
- Shape Up methodology discussion: appetite-based rather than scoring
- Definition of Done (DoD) for every project
- Keep tracking separate from L10 ("sacred ground")

**Podcast (Feb 6 1:1):**
- Kieran's proposal: GBP 5,600/month for bi-weekly shows (~GBP 2,600/episode) -- too expensive
- Decision: podcast "in the freezer" due to bandwidth and cash flow constraints
- Acknowledged as valuable future channel but currently a distraction vs simpler marketing

**Personal Check-ins:**
- Vahid needs gym/workout routine (Jan 16)
- Ryan encouraged Vahid's gym interaction as personal growth moment
- Vahid prioritizing self-care: physio, chiropractic, osteopathy
- Dominican Republic trip March 4 -- need to complete e-ticket form

## 9. Personal Context

- **Vahid's health/self-care:** Actively doing physio, chiropractic, osteopathy. This is a significant positive change from previous months. Needs gym/workout routine. Had a personal growth moment at gym (initially leaving but calling back to commit).
- **Couples therapy:** On Vahid's calendar (Feb 6)
- **Elmira:** Vahid's partner. Dominican Republic trip planned for March 4. Need hotel/flight details for e-ticket form.
- **Vahid's energy:** Completing the website gave him energy and momentum. Not posting on LinkedIn this week was a source of stress. Finishing projects is energizing. Documenting ideas "calms his mind."
- **Vahid's shame:** Admitted his own shame about the business not running as planned is preventing him from giving Ryan necessary feedback and addressing the cash position problem (Feb 11 Courtney sync).
- **Vahid's mood:** "Spiraling" was mentioned in context of Ryan but reflects broader stress. Networking events (Clockwork Meetup) are energizing and productive.
- **Ali situation:** Vahid terminated his brother Ali from the business (Jan 26). Emotional conflict -- Ali said "I don't want to be your employee." Likely personally difficult.
- **Hamed Jafari:** Working on podcast editing test (Persian-language content). Personal/professional relationship.
- **Meraj intro:** Connected with fellow Persian-background product leader. Potential future bench talent. Good personal chemistry ("coffee sometime").
- **Office dissatisfaction:** Both Vahid and Courtney unhappy with current office, considering coworking alternatives (Feb 2).
