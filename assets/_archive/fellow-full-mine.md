- Target: $50M monthly production → scale to $100M
- Outperform existing marketing ROI
- Team structure, org structure, tech stack improvements
- Agile transformation (implemented last year, 2-week sprints)

**Challenges:**
- Funnel leakage at multiple stages (search ad → lead form, PII collection)
- Legacy team resistance to digital processes
- Business struggling to accept agile pace
- Lack of definitive stakeholders for process decisions
- Inherited systems without clear documentation
- Cultural resistance from long-time industry veterans

**Skunk Works Approach Discussed:**
- Separate team walled off from legacy systems
- Different rules than rest of org
- Fast feedback cycles
- Parallel analytic structure with different data pipelines
- Shortened audit phase: 2-4 weeks instead of 4-8 weeks

**Fractional CPO Candidates:**
- Narrowed 100+ to **5 finalists**
- Requirements: 10+ years PM experience, public company fintech, SOX compliance, digital transformation
- Experience: Onboarding, acquisition optimization, dealing with legacy/compliance teams, M&A integration
- One candidate to be presented after selection

**Next Steps (Sept 20):**
- Huddle and align, provide feedback by end of day
- Schedule follow-up in 2 weeks (after Kristen's travel)
- Meet fractional CPO candidate
- Discuss engagement model and budget

**Outcome:** Unknown, no follow-up meetings captured

## 6. Business Model Evolution

### Fractional CPO Service Structure

**Three Service Tiers:**
1. **Interim (Full-time):** $50-70K/month (or $30-70K depending on role/company)
2. **Fractional:** $17K/month for 1.5-2 days/week
3. **Advisory:** $7K/month for ~3 hours/week
4. **Audit:** $4K for 2 weeks (no commitment, discovery-only option)

**Engagement Structure:**
- Minimum 3-month engagement
- Retainer model (fees due beginning of month)
- Access to assigned product person + management layer + "Council of CPOs" for specialized advice
- Every engagement starts with 2-4 week audit period (shortened to 1 week for interim roles)
- Unlike recruitment agencies: Present only one carefully vetted candidate (reputation behind placement)

**Timeline:**
- Initial qualification call
- 1-3 discovery calls with relevant team members
- Introduce selected candidate
- Contracting
- If client hires interim executive full-time → recruiter fee charged

**Positioning:**
- **Anti-build philosophy:** Focus on optimizing existing products, not building new features
- **Interim CPO role:** Not traditional consultants
- **Product management only:** "The opposite of a one-stop shop" — no engineering services
- **Location-agnostic:** Work globally (many US clients due to proximity + LinkedIn algorithm)
- **Council of CPOs:** 3-tier structure: (1) CPO of record, (2) Partner layer, (3) Council for expert advice

### Inbound Lead Generation (Nov 2024)

- **3-5 inbound leads per week** (Vahid, Nov 19)
- Minimal marketing: Daily LinkedIn posts only
- Website ranks high for "fractional CPO" searches without SEO optimization
- Typical clients: Bootstrapped, tech-enabled businesses, good founders, ~10 years operation, looking to reach next level
- Often lack product and marketing teams (just sales + tech)

### Target Market Evolution

**Initial (2024-early 2025):**
- Bootstrapped tech-enabled businesses
- Pre-seed and seed stages struggling with product-market fit
- SMEs (98% of companies don't operate like tech startups)

**Shift to PE Focus (Late 2025-2026):**
- **ICP:** PE-backed companies approaching exit events
- Minimum $200M ARR
- 5-6 years from initial PE investment
- Firms seeking 3-5x exits in 5-7 years
- **Tagline:** "Revenue growth through product leadership for PE backed companies"
- **SAFE framework targeting:** Companies dissatisfied with overly prescribed SAFE process

### Revenue & Financial Model

**2025 Performance:**
- Revenue: ~$2M total (referenced as "high seven figures" in Meraj call)
- Primary from CTCT engagement (April-December 2025)

**2026 Targets (set Jan-Feb):**
- **$4M USD revenue** from **3 concurrent clients**
- Team size: ~10 people across 3 accounts
- At least 1 deal in negotiation by March 31
- 5 verified sales opportunities by March 1

**Current State (Feb 2026):**
- **Zero revenue** (pre-revenue build mode)
- **Runway:** ~6 months through July 2026 (~$100K+ in bank)
- **Ryan's cost:** $22K/month ($264K/year) — "financially irresponsible" given zero revenue
- **Fast-approaching "cash zero date"** (reason for Ryan termination)

### Acquisition Interest (Dec 2024)

- Offer from "new binaries" (not pursued)
- **2 PE firms indicated:** If achieve $22M revenue + 20% EBITDA (~$10M total) → willing to purchase for **1.5x revenue**
- Valuation could increase to **2-3x revenue** with tools (PRD writer, GPT solutions) — "super easy to spin up"
- Vahid uncertain about wanting to sell but acknowledged it makes situation "more interesting"

### Corporate Structure Evolution

**2024-2025:**
- US LLC
- Partnership: Vahid + JP + Courtney

**Late 2025-Early 2026:**
- **JP separation:** Release agreement, full severance by Feb 1
- **US LLC dissolution:** Filed, expected mid-February completion (requested extension to March 1 for CTCT payment)
- **Canadian corporation established:** Oct 31 fiscal year end
  - Tax efficiency: Dividends between Canadian corps tax-free
  - Owner and Ven banking completed
  - Delay US LLC formation until needed for client contracts
- **Banking:** VEN business account new, Mercury funds moved, RBC business account closed
- **Chart of accounts** set up for new business
- **Tax:** 1099s filed, W8 forms kept for international contractors

### Sales & Marketing Infrastructure (Jan-Feb 2026)

**LinkedIn Automation (ALO):**
- HeyReach fully set up, billing configured
- 3 LinkedIn profiles: Heather/VP (17% acceptance), Nadia/Director (10%), Thea (3.4%)
- ~45 connection requests/day across 3 profiles
- Sales Nav initially blocker, resolved

**LinkedIn Posting:**
- Automation system complete (Feb 11)
- **36 posts scheduled and live**
- Readwise integration for tagged content
- Vahid built system (weekends/evenings investment)

**Email Infrastructure:**
- **Instantly** configured with 5 burner domains warming up
- Protecting main fractionalcpo.com domain
- Warm-up takes several weeks

**Outreach Execution:**
- **Vector site visitors:** Ryan messaging ~60 leads (from 200+), ~40% better as recruiting candidates
- **Manual LinkedIn outreach (MLO):** Concise two-line messages
- **TF-IDF mental model** for core anchors
- Website visitor tracking: Outreach appears "serendipitous/cold" rather than revealing tracking
- **Signature testing:** Experimenting with removal of title entirely ("Vahid Fractional CPO") vs partner/CEO

**Lead Lists:**
- Two existing lists (Ali's and Ryan's) need reconciliation
- Segmented by role: CPOs/product leaders separate from C-suite
- **Apollo** being considered for lead enrichment (low cost)

**Content & Collateral:**
- **Website v1 completed** (late Jan) — major milestone, gave Vahid energy
- Subpages planned: PE offerings, AI offerings, case studies
- **Case study urgency:** CTCT case study only fresh Q1 2026 (per Mauricio Feb 10)
- **One-pager + case study** needed before Reforge reactivation (end of Feb)

**Tracking & Funnel:**
- Marketing roadmap in Notion: Website v1 → LinkedIn posting → ALO → Website content → LinkedIn engagement
- "Now, Next, Later" prioritization model
- Shape Up methodology: Appetite-based rather than scoring
- Definition of Done (DoD) for every project
- Keep tracking separate from L10 ("sacred ground")

**Podcast (Frozen):**
- Kieran's proposal: GBP 5,600/month for bi-weekly shows (~GBP 2,600/episode) — too expensive
- Decision: "In the freezer" due to bandwidth and cash flow constraints
- Acknowledged as valuable future channel but distraction vs simpler marketing
- **Persian podcast:** Separate initiative with Hamed, bi-weekly, 16:9 format

**Sales Channels:**
- ALO (automated LinkedIn)
- MLO (manual LinkedIn)
- Referrals (top priority: Vella)
- ~~Helpful Podcast~~ (frozen)
- LinkedIn posting/engagement
- Substack (contrarianproduct.com)

**Prioritization:**
- **Flipped strategy:** Active outreach FIRST, then passive content development (Feb 6)
- Zero-to-one milestone: Vector site visitor outreach (Feb 10)

## 7. Pipeline & Opportunities (Feb 2026 Status)

### Active Prospects

| Prospect | Status | Source | Next Action |
|----------|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Trader (Bowden)** | VP wants reorg, CEO meeting Feb 12-19 | Existing relationship | Dedicated #fcpo-Trader Slack channel. Slow-rolling but active. |
| **Behringer Capital** | Intro via Mark Kirschner | Warm referral | Pattern: Gets excited, drops off, comes back. Dave meeting pending. Vahid to analyze portfolio companies. |
| **Daniel Burns / Main+Main** | Real estate dev, AI ops | Inbound | Not yet in CRM. Leverage with Coastal via Patrick Murphy connection. |
| **Coastal Construction** | Follow-up ~early Feb | Previous contact | Will add to CRM. Patrick Murphy asked for follow-up. |
| **Nikhil (fCMO)** | Call completed Feb 10 | Network | Assessment one-pager for Tampa Bay Times due Feb 16. |

### Top Referral Source: Vella

- Former CTCT CEO Frank Vella
- Currently in Toronto dealing with death in family
- Plan: Dinner, secure referral agreement
- **CRITICAL:** CTCT door now closed, so Vella referrals are essential

### Strategic Direction: CTCT Competitors

- **NEW (Feb 13):** Targeting Constant Contact competitors
- MSA explicitly non-exclusive
- Vahid has maximum leverage with competitors right now (immediately post-CTCT)
- Multiple advisors confirmed approach
- Researching competitors, checking LinkedIn connections to avoid drama
- Ryan processing research and outreach strategy

### Pipeline Issues & Gaps

**Not Being Pursued:**
- **Brunetti / Constant Contact:** Vahid sees leadership gap in execution, reached out to demonstrate understanding, but communication challenges noted. NOT pursuing as close — instead targeting CTCT competitors.

**Dropped / Frozen:**
- **Reforge partnership:** Backed by Insight Partners. Ajay Gandhi (EVP Onsite) visited fractionalcpo.com. Need collateral (one-pager + case study) before re-engaging. Timeline: End of Feb once website content pages ready.
- **Finance of America:** Ryan checking with Vahid's contact about experience before sending draft to Kristen.
- **Auto Trader Group:** Expansion discussed Dec 2025, no follow-up recorded.

**Old Leads Referenced:**
- **Dave** (unknown company): Non-responsive. Plan: Contact Mark if Dave doesn't respond.

### Sales Funnel Metrics (Set Feb 3)

- **By Feb 28:** 5+ verified sales opportunities (Vahid validated in person, budget + urgency confirmed)
- **By Mar 31:** At least 1 deal in negotiation stage (discussing terms)
- **By Year-end:** $4M revenue from 3 large clients

### Historical Model

- Entirely inbound leads and referrals (pre-2026)
- Consulting fees "too high for the market"
- Prefer employment engagements over consulting

---

## 8. Team Dynamics & Operational Cadences

### Meeting Evolution

**April-June 2025 (CTCT Active):**
- Daily stand-up (fCPO team)
- Weekly bench + sales review
- Weekly Vahid + Courtney 1:1
- Daily Ryan + Vahid check-in (evolved from 1hr to 30min Mon-Thu, 1hr Fri)
- L10 meetings
- ProdOps weekly (later canceled)
- Mauricio 1:1 on Tuesdays (rescheduled for CTCT standup)

**January-February 2026 (Sales Mode):**
- **Daily stand-up moved to ~4pm** (from 12pm) — better for deep work blocks
- **Daily stand-up made optional** (Feb 11) — 12pm was interrupting workflow
- **L10 made optional/issue-driven** (Feb 11) — sales and bench reviews cover critical workstreams
- Weekly bench + sales review
- Weekly Vahid + Courtney 1:1
- Daily Ryan + Vahid check-in (terminated with Ryan on Feb 12)

### Team Strengths & Challenges

**Vahid + JP** (Pre-Jan 2026):
- Core strategy duo
- Divided workstreams: JP handles program ownership + PLG, Vahid handles product partnership + CPO role + M&A

**Vahid + Ryan:**
- Daily check-ins iterated multiple times to balance efficiency with alignment
- Ryan's workload: Tendency to overcommit. Agreed to carve out half day for unexpected tasks. Morning walks recommended.
- Ryan characterized as "emotionally regulated and proactive" — net positive but requiring frequent feedback
- **Problem:** Vahid's shame about business not running as planned prevented giving necessary feedback
- **Resolution:** Ryan terminated Feb 12 due to cash constraints

**Vahid + Courtney:**
- Weekly 1:1, strategic alignment on hiring, corporate structure, culture
- Vahid positioning himself and Courtney as "package deal" for engagements
- **Challenge:** Both Courtney and Ryan viewed as "too similar for company size" — external advisors would likely recommend removing one
- Courtney handling recruiting (10 calls/week), financial oversight, compensation structuring

**Mauricio:**
- Bandwidth concerns given full-time CTCT employment
- **URGENT:** Negotiation must happen before leads convert (he'll fight harder once revenue visible)
- 3 responsibility buckets: (1) Growth assessment tool, (2) Sales call appearances, (3) Coach/overseer for product growth
- Advisor partner with weekly check-ins
- Compensation: 2 points permanent + ~5 points initiative-specific

**Ali (Brother):**
- Conflict escalated Jan 26: "I don't want to be your employee"
- Terminated by end of week
- Performance under evaluation at time of conflict
- Ryan took over outreach campaigns

### Lessons Learned

- "Stop working with non-specialists regardless of friendship status" — need clear structure when working with friends
- Need defined cultural traits framework (in-person session planned Feb 3 with Vahid + Courtney)
- Networking-first approach: Connect with potential recruits through networking rather than formal interviews
- Vahid's #1 hiring criterion: **Low ego**
- Meraj's framework: "Humble, curious, and hungry"
- Reference check policy: Conduct BEFORE final 90-minute interviews to avoid wasted effort
- Market observation: Unemployed senior talent potentially available at lower rates (Feb 2026)

## 10. Key Insights & Patterns

### Business Model Insights

1. **Inbound to Outbound Shift:** Historical model (entirely inbound/referrals) shifting to proactive outbound (LinkedIn automation, email campaigns, PE targeting) as CTCT anchor ended.

2. **PE Focus Sharpening:** From bootstrapped SMEs to PE-backed $200M+ ARR companies approaching exits. More defined ICP, higher deal sizes, longer sales cycles.

3. **Positioning Evolution:** From "fractional consultants" to "interim CPO" framing. Clients respond better to employment relationship than consulting engagement. Performance-based pricing tested with CTCT.

4. **Packaging Tension:** CTCT wanted individuals, fCPO sells "Council of CPOs" system. Need to clarify whether selling people or platform.

5. **Margin Pressure:** Gorilla interim roles described as "highest-paying but lowest-margin." Interim full-time = more revenue but less leverage than fractional placements.

### CTCT Engagement Lessons

1. **Misalignment on Value:** CTCT focused on cost reduction, fCPO focused on growth/transformation. Core disconnect from start.

2. **Authority Gap:** Frustrated with "limited authority as consultants" vs true interim executives. Consultant label reduced influence.

3. **Communication Gaps:** Lee (CPO) had communication issues, controlled renewal, never fully aligned. Lack of executive sponsor post-Frank.

4. **Results vs Perception:** Claimed strong results (50% mobile conversion improvement, best growth in 11 years, doubled activation in 4 months) but couldn't convert to renewal. Question: Were results real or attribution unclear?

5. **Transition Failure:** Dec 29 rescission of all offers after months of transition planning. Suggests either fundamental misalignment or internal CTCT politics derailed deal.

### Team & Operational Insights

1. **Partnership Fragility:** JP departed January 2026 after ~1 year. Release agreement, full severance. Suggests partnership tensions or misalignment on vision/compensation.

2. **Family Business Risks:** Ali (brother) conflict escalated publicly ("I don't want to be your employee"), led to termination. Lesson: "Stop working with non-specialists regardless of friendship."

3. **Burn Rate Crisis:** Ryan at $22K/month = $264K/year described as "financially irresponsible" with zero revenue. Terminated Feb 12 due to "fast-approaching cash zero date." Suggests 6-month runway may be overstated or burning faster than expected.

4. **Role vs Cost Mismatch:** Ryan characterized as "EA-level" but paid Chief of Staff salary. Courtney and Ryan "too similar" for company size. Suggests overstaffing for current stage.

5. **Shame Blocking Feedback:** Vahid admitted shame about business not running as planned prevented giving Ryan necessary feedback. Personal feelings interfering with business decisions.

### Sales & Marketing Insights

1. **Automation Investment:** Heavy investment in LinkedIn automation (HeyReach, 3 profiles, 36 posts scheduled) and email infrastructure (Instantly, 5 domains). Suggests belief that outbound at scale is answer to revenue problem.

2. **Conversion Rates:** LinkedIn connection acceptance rates vary widely (17% for VP profiles, 3.4% for others). Signals matter for cold outreach.

3. **Competitor Strategy:** Targeting CTCT competitors immediately post-engagement shows strategic thinking (maximum leverage now) but also potential risk (reputation, relationships).

4. **Content as Afterthought:** Flipped strategy from content-first to outreach-first. Pragmatic pivot recognizing need for immediate revenue vs long-term brand building.

5. **Case Study Urgency:** CTCT case study "only fresh Q1 2026" — suggests awareness that recency of results matters for credibility. Clock ticking on relevance.

### Financial Health Signals

**Positive:**
- 6-month runway through July (~$100K+ in bank)
- Canadian corp setup (tax efficiency)
- Strong historical revenue (~$2M in 2025)
- Inbound lead flow (3-5/week as of Nov 2024)

**Concerning:**
- **Zero current revenue** (pre-revenue build mode)
- Ryan termination due to "cash zero date" approaching (contradicts 6-month runway claim?)
- $22K/month burn on single role described as "financially irresponsible"
- Revelate: Net loss of ~$2K (unexpectedly high software charges)
- Heavy software subscription spend being reviewed/cleaned up
- "Fast-approaching cash zero date" language suggests urgency > 6-month comfort

**Interpretation:** 6-month runway may assume reduced burn (post-Ryan termination) or may be optimistic. Company in survival mode.

### Hiring & Culture

1. **Ego as Disqualifier:** Vahid's #1 criterion is "low ego." Garrett had "douchebag psychopath vibes" — culture fit trumps skills.

2. **Humble, Curious, Hungry:** Meraj framework resonated. Suggests values alignment on learning orientation, not arrogance.

3. **Recruiting Volume:** Courtney doing 10 calls/week, posting across multiple Slack communities (Lenny, Reforge, Mind the Product, True North CTO, Chat PRD, Product School). High activity, unclear conversion.

4. **Candidate Pool:** Identifying VPs/leaders who stepped back to IC roles for execution/learning. Specific profile = experienced but not ego-driven.

5. **Reference Checks Early:** Policy to conduct before final 90-min interviews to avoid wasted effort. Pragmatic time-saving.

### Personal Context

1. **Health Focus:** Vahid actively doing physio, chiro, osteo. Positive change from previous months. Needs gym routine. Self-care prioritization amid business stress.

2. **Relationship:** Couples therapy on calendar (Feb 6). Dominican Republic trip planned March 4. Suggests work-life balance attention.

3. **Energy Sources:** "Finishing projects is energizing" — Website completion gave Vahid energy. Not posting on LinkedIn was source of stress. Suggests need for visible progress/momentum.

4. **Shame & Vulnerability:** Vahid admitting shame about business not running as planned is significant self-awareness but also indicates emotional burden affecting decisions.

5. **Network Events:** Clockwork Meetup described as "energizing and productive." In-person networking works for Vahid, should prioritize.

### Previously Undocumented Context

**Acquisition Interest:**
- Offer from "new binaries" (not pursued)
- 2 PE firms: $22M revenue + 20% EBITDA → 1.5x revenue buyout (2-3x with tools)
- Vahid uncertain about selling but finds it "interesting"

**Early 2024 Fractional CPO Business:**
- 3-5 inbound leads/week with minimal marketing (just LinkedIn posts)
- Website ranking high for "fractional CPO" without SEO
- Custom GPT for writing proposals
- Track record: 90 products shipped, 8 exits, 200+ vetted CPOs

**Discovery Call Insights:**

- Maestra: 26 employees, AI transcription/dubbing, pricing complexity
- Finance of America: $3M/month marketing spend, call-center dependent, seeking digital transformation
- Togal: Construction tech, $47K/3-month proposal, Sprint Zero approach

**CTCT Detailed Context:**
- Eric Raab (CTO) presented 300-person engineering org challenges
- Next Gen initiative: 20-person team building on new platform
- Compensation system gameable (modest goals encouraged)
- Missing 1.5-2 year horizons roadmap
- Mobile conversion gap: 20% desktop vs much lower mobile
- Google mobile marketing budget ~$200K under review
- Premium strategy: $3.5-4M revenue uplift target from upgrades
- Local service businesses & nonprofits = 50%+ account base

**Team Evolution:**
- Ali (brother) terminated Jan 26 after "I don't want to be your employee" conflict
- JP release agreement, full severance by Feb 1, LLC dissolution
- Ryan terminated Feb 12 due to cash constraints ($22K/month unsustainable)
- Mauricio negotiation URGENT before leads convert

**Financial Reality:**
- Zero revenue Feb 2026 (pre-revenue build mode)

- Ryan's $264K annual cost described as "financially irresponsible"
- 6-month runway claim vs urgent cost-cutting suggests strain
