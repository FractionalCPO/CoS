## Key Topics and Themes

### Business Structure
- **FractionalCPO** is the core business entity run by Vahid Jozi
- The workspace has ~12 active human members plus numerous bot integrations
- High turnover evident: 14+ deleted accounts vs 12 active, suggesting contractor/consultant rotation

### Team Composition (Active)
- **Vahid Jozi** — Founder, Fractional CPO
- **Courtney Cunningham** — Partner (notable: has her own Claude MCP bot)
- **Kerry** (email.kmo) — Active member
- **Matt Thomas** — Active member
- **Nawid Fatahi** — Active member (re-joined after earlier departure)
- **Mauricio Idarraga** — Active member (re-joined after earlier departure)
- **Ryan Arthur** — Active member
- **Hamed** — Active member
- **Bohdan Zabawskyj** — Active member
- **Jay Shin** — Active member
- **Oz** — Active member

### Notable Departed Members
- **JP Moya**, **Elizabeth Creighton**, **Robbie Katz**, **Rob Kenedi**, **Trixie Pama**, **Ximena Giron**, **Karim Awad**, **Mohammad Bashir**, **David Kozak**, **Michelle Yick**, **Ali Jozi** (family member?)

### Channel Topics Reveal Business Focus
1. **Sales & Prospecting**: #fractionalcpo_sales, #prospect-trader
2. **Marketing**: #fcpo-marketing, #linkedin-posting (LinkedIn is a key channel)
3. **Operations**: #fcpo-time-off, #all-slack
4. **Technology**: #fcpo-ai-tools, #vector-site-visitors (visitor analytics)
5. **External**: #fellow-botless-recorded-beta-testers (20 members — participation in Fellow's beta)

### Tool Stack (from bot integrations)
- **Productivity**: Notion, Fellow, Todoist, Google Calendar, Google Drive
- **Communication**: Zoom, Calendly, Slack
- **Development**: GitHub, Jira, Cursor, Figma
- **AI/Automation**: Abacus.AI, Donna (custom Claude bot), Claude MCP - Courtney, Granola, Notion AI
- **Sales/Marketing**: Vector (site visitors), Paragon (integrations)

### AI-Heavy Organization
- Multiple AI bots: Donna, Claude MCP - Courtney, Abacus.AI, Cursor, Notion AI, Granola
- Dedicated #fcpo-ai-tools channel
- Suggests strong AI-forward culture and heavy automation investment

### Data Limitations
- **No channel history accessible** — bot needs to be invited to channels via `/invite @Donna`
- **DMs are nearly empty** — only a single test message exists
- Most organizational context is locked behind channel invitations
- To get richer context, invite Donna to: #all-slack, #fcpo-marketing, #linkedin-posting, #prospect-trader, #fcpo-ai-tools, #vector-site-visitors

---

## Next Steps to Unlock More Context
1. Have Vahid run `/invite @Donna` in key channels (especially #all-slack, #fcpo-marketing, #prospect-trader)
2. Re-run channel history mining after bot is invited
3. Consider adding `channels:join` scope to allow bot self-joining public channels
