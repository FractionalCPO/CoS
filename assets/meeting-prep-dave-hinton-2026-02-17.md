## Context

- First-ever meeting. No prior calls or email history beyond scheduling.
- Mark Kirschner offered intro Jan 27, completed it Feb 5. Dave responded and booked the call.
- Mark is a strategic advisor to fCPO (10% rev share per signed referral for 12 months). This is Mark's active referral.
- Dave's background is deeply technical/operational — he'll understand product strategy language. He's not a finance-only PE guy.
- Beringer's model of embedding operating partners = natural alignment with fCPO's embedded interim CPO approach.

## Key Topics

1. **Beringer's product leadership model** — How do they currently handle product strategy across portfolio companies? Do operating partners cover product, or is that a gap? Dave's own role likely covers digital/marketing strategy — product may be adjacent but not his core.

2. **Portfolio company pain points** — 3 of 7 active portfolio companies are in services-to-platform transitions:
   - **Dig Insights** (VERY HIGH fit) — Upsiide SaaS platform, 3 of 4 founders just stepped back. $0 → SaaS revenue transition. Toronto-based.
   - **Northern Commerce** (HIGH fit) — Integrating 3 acquisitions (Freedom Marketing + Project 3 in March 2025). CEO is Mark Kelley, another Beringer Operating Partner. $68M revenue.
   - **Bold Orange** (HIGH fit) — Acquired Aug 2025 from Mountaingate Capital. 160+ employees. CX agency with Salesforce/data capabilities ripe for productization.

3. **fCPO value proposition** — "Portfolio-level product leadership resource." Not a one-off hire. Repeatable operating lever Beringer can deploy across portfolio companies in growth or transition phases.
   - Anchor case: CTCT — $70M/yr product budget, 50% mobile conversion lift, best growth month in 11 years, doubled activation in 4 months.

4. **Pattern match** — Beringer's investment thesis (tech-enabled services, data/analytics-led B2B) overlaps heavily with where fCPO operates. Services-to-SaaS transitions are our sweet spot.

## Questions

1. "How does Beringer typically handle product strategy at portfolio companies — is that something operating partners cover, or is there usually a gap?"
2. "Which portfolio companies are you closest to right now? Are any of them going through product leadership transitions?"
3. "Dig Insights just had 3 founders step back — is there a product leadership gap there, or have they backfilled?"
4. "What's the typical engagement model when you bring in outside expertise — do you prefer to introduce us to portfolio CEOs directly, or does it go through the firm first?"
5. "Are there any active M&A targets where product diligence would be valuable before close?"

## Strategic Play

**Goal:** Position fCPO as a repeatable resource in Beringer's value creation playbook — not a one-time vendor.

**Approach:**
- Lead with curiosity, not pitch. Understand how Dave operates, what he owns, where he sees gaps.
- Name Dig Insights specifically — it's the strongest fit and the most time-sensitive (founders just stepped back).
- If Dave is receptive, the ask is introductions to portfolio company CEOs (Paul Gaudette at Dig, Mark Kelley at Northern, Margaret Murphy at Bold Orange).
- Secondary ask: introduction to Perry Miele or Gil Ozir for a portfolio-wide conversation about fCPO as a firm-level resource.

**What NOT to do:**
- Don't pitch all 7 portfolio companies. Focus on Dig Insights as the anchor, mention Northern and Bold Orange as pattern reinforcement.
- Don't talk pricing or engagement terms — too early. This is relationship-building.
- Don't oversell. Dave is an operator — he'll respect substance over sizzle.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Dave understands what fCPO does and sees the fit with Beringer's portfolio
- [ ] Identified at least 1 portfolio company where there's a real product leadership gap
- [ ] Secured a next step — ideally an intro to a portfolio company CEO or a follow-up with Perry/Gil
- [ ] Mark Kirschner's referral feels validated — Dave should walk away thinking "good intro"

## Status

**Pre-call.** First meeting. Discovery/relationship-building only.
