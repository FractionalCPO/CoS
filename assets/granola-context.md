## FractionalCPO Business Operations

### Financial Model (Feb 12, 2026 -- Model Review)

- **Profit sharing**:
  - Vahid: 32.5%
  - Courtney: existing %
  - Mauricio: 7.5%
  - Delivery managers: 5% of account profit
- **Account scenarios modeled**:
  - Small: 1 person, 6 months, $180k delivery cost
  - Medium: 3 people, 9 months, includes consultants
  - Big: 5 people, 12 months, $1.6M total cost
- **Rate structure**:
  - Senior delivery managers: $30k/month
  - Junior consultants: $20k/month
  - Client billing: $600k (senior), $400k (junior)
  - Target margin: 40%
- **Fixed expenses**: $10k/month + 10% general expenses per account

### Referral Fee Structure (proposed)

- Old: 10% of first-year revenue (too high)
- New proposal: 25% of first scope only OR tiered by deal size:
  - $200k deals: 20%
  - $500k deals: 15%
  - $1M+ deals: 7%
- Assessment pricing: $45k for 1 month, 25% referral fee on assessment

### Personnel Decisions

- **Ryan Arthur terminated** (Feb 2026): $22k/mo too expensive with $0 revenue. Contract auto-renewed through March. Must pay $10k remainder.
- **JP Saker separated** (Jan 2026): Release agreement drafted, $1,000 settlement. Remove bank/Slack/LinkedIn access. No client contact.
- **Hiring plan**: Replace Ryan with product management student as EA/apprentice. Budget ~$90k vs Ryan's higher cost.

### Service Positioning (Jan 27 - Courtney call)

- Do NOT describe as "fractional work"
- Position as full-time placement with assessment-led approach
- Partners involved in assessment, then engagement manager leads
- Target: PE-backed software companies at "exit stage"
- Four levers: product strategy, product team, product talent, product growth, product process
- Product growth is strongest differentiator

### Website & SEO (Feb 3 - Ali Abbas / Jan 27 - Mauricio)

- **SEO issues** (Ali Abbas assessment):
  - Only 1 indexed page, very low domain authority
  - Title tag/meta description over-optimized and cut off
  - Need: FAQ section, service landing pages, blogging strategy
  - Link building budget: $1-2k/month needed
  - Consider "interim CPO" keyword (better search volume)
- **Website copy** (Mauricio feedback):
  - Too long, not punchy, poor mobile experience
  - CTA unclear
  - Pain-focused copy beats social proof
  - Simple contact form (name/email/message), no calendar link
  - Tagline "Product leadership for companies that can't afford to wait" too lengthy

### Podcast ("Helpful Podcast")

- 9 episodes already recorded
- Izabela Russell handling production (Music Radio Creative)
- Biweekly publishing recommended
- Three production tiers; starting with basic/mid
- Hamed delivered LinkedIn/Canva designs ($300 paid)

## Constant Contact Engagement

*Comprehensive record of the major client engagement Jul 2025 - Dec 2025*

### Phase 1: Assessment & Entry (Jul-Aug 2025)

- **Jul 18**: QBR prep -- Jessica (partnerships VP) just terminated, UK business under evaluation, Giannis (Moosend founder) joining as growth band leader
- **Aug 21**: Steph Ting call -- diagnosed product org dysfunction. Strozak = "mini Russ." No operating cadence. Josh blocked for 3 years. Proposed 4 growth bands + product ops structure.
- **Aug 21**: Emily Mias sync -- identified strong performers (Emily, Catherine, Ryan Levery). Planned departures. SOW due next day.
- **Aug 22**: Growth strategy -- targeting net add goal. Activation analysis: 26K accounts paid Q1, only 9K retained D90-D120. Mobile severely broken. 10% activation = 155 net adds.
- **Aug 25**: Performance metrics -- $700K invested, $1.2M more planned. Defined success metrics: activation 18% to 16%, 16K net adds, 25 experiments/quarter. Negotiated risk-sharing structure.
- **Aug 28**: Strategy with Giannis -- Moosend acquisition struggling. Identified strong PMs (Emily, Catherine, Ryan Levery, Jesus, Kyle). Textify product failing.
- **Aug 28**: Tools evaluation -- recommended Reforge ($6M benefit), Fellow, Cursor, Glean. Targeting $2M savings removing Quantum Metrics + Pendo.

### Phase 2: Org Restructure & Growth Bands (Sep 2025)

- **Sep 4**: Talent assessment finalized. Exit list prepared. Satish kept for tribal knowledge despite poor reviews.
- **Sep 9**: Major layoffs -- 4 design + 5 product people. Growth bands structure announced. Org flattened from 2 to 8 direct reports.
- **Sep 9**: Q4 AI strategy -- prompt-to-email as primary bet. Cleaned up scattered AI approach.
- **Sep 9**: Yannis weekly -- defined growth strategy: social product, digital starters, core AI integration. 500K active users x $5/mo AI add-on = major revenue.
- **Sep 11**: Product Operating Cadence meeting -- formalized growth band delivery framework. Flex engineering teams. Two-path delivery model.
- **Sep 12**: Product ops with Frank -- 12 marketing layoffs. Alpa offer made. Reforge contract closing. Growth experiments showing 20% higher TTP.

### Phase 3: Strategy & Planning (Oct-Nov 2025)

- **Oct 20**: 2026 strategy -- AI assessment positive (GPT+Grok foundation solid). Mobile 2 generations behind. Vision for Instagram-level simplicity. Target new ICP vs dying boomer demographic.
- **Nov 13**: Roadmap planning -- $570M baseline revenue. 100+ experiments/quarter target. Major gap: no upsell/cross-sell capabilities.
- **Nov 13**: Emily acquisition strategy -- CTCT attempting acquisition. Emily severely underpaid ($200k vs $1.5-2M market). Equity play discussed.
- **Nov 15**: Frank Vella call -- Lee performing well. Smitta territorial. Luis (AI lead) being replaced by Aditya. Shane strong.
- **Nov 17**: Reforge Insights demo -- platform aggregates customer feedback from all sources. 3 weeks research -> 10 minutes. $3M impact cited.
- **Nov 18**: Vahid/JP -- Oscar needs coaching. Social media tool abandoned too early. Daylight partnership: $30K prototype, FCPO owns IP.
- **Nov 24**: CTCT Standup -- compensation negotiation: $400k base + $400k signing + equity (0.33% = $5M over 2-3 years). Net ads increase: $2.6M over 3 months.
- **Nov 25**: Vahid/Lee -- two role options for Vahid (core product leadership OR strategy/planning chief of staff). Jamie to International. JP not VP-ready.
- **Nov 26**: Vella wants fCPO to join CTCT -- detailed equity/compensation analysis. $560M revenue, 42-43% EBITDA. Exit starting within month. Proposed: VP for Vahid ($2.6M total), Senior Directors for JP/Mauricio/Oz ($2.2M each), Director for Courtney ($1.1M).

### Phase 4: Deal Collapse (Dec 2025)

- **Dec 2-4**: Continued 2026 planning (Premium strategy, New Routes, partnerships) as if engagement continuing
- **Dec 2025**: Acquisition deal collapsed. Vahid overplayed solicitation fee negotiation (30% of salaries). All offers rescinded. 3 team members hired individually by client.

## Important Decisions & Action Items

### Critical / Urgent (Feb 2026)

1. **Ryan terminated** -- must pay $10k for March remainder. Replace with cheaper EA/apprentice (~$90k).
2. **Revenue = $0** -- $200K cash reserves, 6-week runway for fixed costs.
3. **Close new business urgently** -- Lightspeed (in-person meeting pending), Tampa Bay Times (Nikhil one-pager), Trader (active lead).
4. **JP release agreement** -- $1,000 settlement, transfer Slack, remove access.

### Business Development Actions

5. **SEO improvements** (per Ali Abbas): H1 keyword, FAQ section, service landing pages, blog strategy, link building.
6. **Website redesign** (per Mauricio): shorter, mobile-first, pain-focused copy, simple contact form.
7. **Outbound scaling**: Ali running 60 LinkedIn msgs/day across 4 audience segments.
8. **Podcast launch**: 9 episodes ready, biweekly cadence, Izabela handling production.
9. **LSEG trial**: test PE data platform for prospect targeting.

### IONODES Actions

10. **Vahid**: Intro to City of Montreal digital transformation contacts.
11. **Product Strategy Committee**: as-needed meetings with Eric, Cary, Fred.

### Financial Model

12. **Referral fees**: Switch to 25% first scope OR tiered structure.
13. **Assessment pricing**: $45k for 1 month standard.
14. **Target margins**: 40% on engagements.

## Strategic Context & Themes

### Business Model Evolution

FractionalCPO is positioning away from "fractional" language toward **full-time embedded product leadership with assessment-led entry**. The model:
1. **Assessment** ($45k, 1 month): Partners involved, evaluate strategy/talent/ops/growth
2. **Embedded team**: Engagement manager + delivery consultants deployed full-time
3. **Exit**: Client either hires team or transitions to advisory

Target: PE-backed software companies at exit stage. Four service levers: product strategy, product team, product talent, product growth, product process. Product growth is the strongest differentiator (most clients haven't seen it).

### Lessons from Constant Contact

The CTCT engagement was transformative but ended badly:
- **What worked**: Assessment-first approach, growth band methodology, experimentation velocity, talent assessment framework, tool deployment (Reforge, Fellow, Cursor)
- **What failed**: Acquisition negotiation -- pushed too hard on solicitation fee while jet-lagged/burned out
- **Key metrics achieved**: Best acquisition month in 11 years, 2.6M net ads increase in 3 months, doubled activation in 6 weeks, 100+ experiments/quarter
- **Team dynamics**: Emily Mias was standout performer; Oz/Emily started dating; JP lacked VP presence; Strozak was major blocker

### Current Financial Pressure

- Revenue dropped to $0 after CTCT
- $200K cash reserves
- Ryan's $22k/mo cost eliminated (terminated Feb 2026)
- Must close within 6 weeks
- 2025 was $3M year; 2026 target $4M with 3+ clients

### Key Relationships to Leverage

- **Frank Vella** (CTCT CEO): Still values the work. Possible contract revival.
- **Emily Mias**: Strong ally at CTCT. Positioning as Head of AI Products.
- **Nikhil Hunshikatti**: Runs parallel practice. Tampa Bay Times connection.
- **Ron Yang**: PE product advisor at SJP. Future referral partner.
- **Adam MacEachern** (Sleek/YC): Zero Click platform. Connected to AI dev tools ecosystem.

### IONODES as Stable Base

Board role provides:
- Steady relationship/income
- Product Strategy Committee involvement
- Montreal/Quebec government connections
- Growing company ($5.8M -> $12M target)
- IoT/security sector credibility

### Hiring Philosophy

- Learned from Ryan: don't hire seasoned executives when you need hungry juniors
- Next hire: product management student as EA/apprentice, offer education in exchange for work
- Budget: ~$90k vs Ryan's $264k
- Don't make hiring decisions during high-stress periods
