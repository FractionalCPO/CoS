## 1. Client Engagements

### Constant Contact (CTCT) — Primary Client (Apr 2025 – Jan 2026)

**Overview:** FractionalCPO's anchor engagement. CTCT was acquired for $1B in 2021. CEO Frank Vella frustrated with spending $70M/year on product with little return. fCPO positioned as interim/fractional CPO rather than traditional consultants.

**Key People at CTCT:**
- **Frank Vella** — CEO. Primary executive sponsor. Frustrated with product ROI.
- **Lee** — CPO (joined mid-engagement). Became fCPO's main point of contact for deal renewals and org restructuring. Communication gaps noted.
- **Brunetti** — Executive, reviewed phase one reports. Vahid reached out post-engagement to demonstrate continued understanding.
- **Pellegrino** and **Bernardino** — Finance/ops contacts for expense approvals.
- **Ashley** — Product leadership; Frank raised questions about what to do with her.
- **Strozak** — Gave an ineffective presentation (debriefed Dec 5).
- **Joshua Castle** — Internal product ops; worked with Courtney on PDLC trial, salary band issues for ProdOps Manager role.
- **Gorav** — Departed, leaving significant gap in mobile app decision-making.
- **Michelle** — Analyzing mobile app usage patterns post-Gorav departure.

**Engagement Timeline:**
- **Apr 2025:** Discovery and proposal phase. JP had prior context. Pitched two workstreams: strategic product bets + org transformation. Three-month structure (mid-Apr to mid-Jul). Reframed from consulting to interim CPO role.
- **May 2025:** Phase one report development. Four deliverables: fCPO memo, product vision strategy, mobile web activation memo, audit report. Focus on Horizon One optimization (not new markets). Emphasized "anti-build" philosophy.
- **Jun 2025:** User research ramp-up (struggled to recruit participants). Hiring senior PM for mobile web/payflow. Stark finding: 20% trial-to-paid on desktop vs. much lower on mobile. Google mobile marketing budget of ~$200K under review.
- **Aug 2025:** Vella call prep — pivoted from running CTCT's org to providing strategic guidance. Performance-based pricing: $3,375 base / $3,900 if targets met (~$120K performance incentives). Focus areas: product growth, social features, AI. Target: 1,700 gross ads by year-end. Org changes: Blaine departing, layoffs planned.
- **Oct 2025:** ProdOps Weekly canceled, replaced by 30-min standup. Growth band vs. core team structure causing confusion. PDLC framework trial with 4-5 PMs.
- **Dec 2025:** Premium strategy development — revenue uplift target of $3.5-4M from upgrades (not new acquisition). Push-pull strategy with usage limits. Local service businesses and nonprofits = 50%+ of account base but lack dedicated workflows. Team distributed globally (Vienna, Costa Rica, Mexico, Spain). Frustration with limited authority as consultants. Deal renewal uncertain — Lee meeting critical.
- **Jan 2026:** Engagement winding down. Vahid reaching out to Brunetti to demonstrate value. Payment resolution pending. FGTM separation underway (removing access to systems).

**Key Results Claimed:**
- 50% improvement in mobile conversions
- CTCT's best month of growth in 11 years
- Doubled activation rates in four months

**fCPO Team on CTCT:**
- **Vahid Jozi** — Lead/CPO role, strategy, exec relationships
- **JP Moya** — Product strategy, vision, premium upsell strategy, strategic bets
- **Courtney Cunningham** — ProdOps, capacity planning, PDLC, expense management
- **Mauricio Idarraga** — Activation, product growth practice, ran experiments independently
- **Nawid Fatahi** — Experiment socialization, pre-planning, mobile functionality
- **Oz Nazilli** — Engagement retention, annual planning, lead magnet work
- **Robbie Katz** — User research, mobile web activation data, interviews
- **Linda** — User researcher (performance concerns; only conducted 1 interview vs. Robbie doing all others)

### Togal.ai — Construction Tech (Mar–Apr 2025)

**Overview:** Construction technology company wanting to build a new estimation tool for pre-construction. Introduced via Oleksandr and Patrick Erin Murphy.

**Key People:**
- **Oleksandr** — Client-side contact for discovery
- **Patrick Erin Murphy** — Construction industry contact; tasked with preparing interview company list (Coastal, Tutor Perini, Winmar, his brother's company)

**Engagement Details:**
- Three phases: solution discovery, proof of concept, beta launch. Six-month timeline.
- Priced at $47K for 3 months half-time PM support.
- fCPO proposed dedicated PM + additional resources for first 3 months.
- Sprint Zero approach: market research, biz/tech strategy, user understanding before building.
- Discussed showcasing prototype at industry conference.
- Robbie Katz assigned as product leader ("expert in zero to one").
- Status: Proposal reviewed Apr 3, 2025. Deck sent. Unclear if engagement proceeded beyond proposal.

### Vella / CTCT Extension (Aug 2025)

## 3. Hiring / Recruiting

### Recruiting Infrastructure

- **ATS (Applicant Tracking System)** — Maintained in Notion. Ryan added Score (1-4) columns. "Homies" category created for friendly contacts who could provide logos/endorsements.
- **Scoring system:** 1-4 scale for hiring decisions, separate from quality tiering system.
- **Courtney** conducting ~10 recruiting calls/week from Slack Lenny channel, passing promising candidates to Vahid.
- **LinkedIn Recruiter** — Courtney exploring for Canadian candidates.
- **Reference checks** — Established policy: conduct before final 90-minute candidate interviews to avoid wasted effort.
- Market observation: unemployed senior talent potentially available at lower rates.

### Candidate Pipeline

| Candidate | Role | Status | Notes |
|-----------|------|--------|-------|
| **Shannon** | Growth PM (for CTCT) | Interview scheduled (Aug 2025) | 30-min interview at 4pm |

- Networking-first approach: connect with potential recruits through networking rather than formal interviews
- Planned in-person session (Vahid + Courtney, Feb 3 2026) to define cultural traits framework
- Lesson learned: "stop working with non-specialists regardless of friendship status" — need clear structure when working with friends

### Team Contractors

- **Ali** — LinkedIn outreach contractor. Contract extended 1 month with lightweight agreement. Performance under evaluation. Costs being monitored.
- **Linda** — User researcher at CTCT. Performance concerns (only 1 interview conducted). Moved to backup interviewer role.

## 5. Strategy / Key Decisions

### Business Model Decisions
