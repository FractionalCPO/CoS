## Contact: Dave Hinton — Operating Partner
- Based in Bellevue, WA. MBA from Washington State, BA from Seattle Pacific
- Co-founded Acerno (data-driven behavioral ad network targeting retail) — sold to Akamai for $95M (2008)
- Post-acquisition: led Akamai's entire advertising solutions division
- 7+ years at Microsoft/MSN — global revenue strategy, yield management, performance advertising
- COO of Channel Factory (YouTube contextual advertising platform, 2022-2024)
- At Beringer since ~2016 — started as Executive-in-Residence (vetting M&A targets), now Operating Partner
- Core DNA: data-driven monetization, operational scaling, build-to-exit. Operator, not a thought leader.
- Intro via Mark Kirschner (ex-CTCT fCMO, being papered as fCPO partner)
- Pattern warning: Behringer contacts "get excited, drop off, come back." Pin down next steps.

## Context
- First-ever meeting with Dave. Brand new contact (created in Clay Feb 12).
- Mark Kirschner opened the door. Unknown what Mark told Dave about fCPO — need to probe.
- Beringer's portfolio has 3 companies in services-to-platform transitions = prime fCPO territory.
- fCPO goal: position as portfolio-level product leadership resource, not a one-off engagement.
- Dual value prop: (1) help PE firm with product diligence on acquisitions, (2) deploy into portfolio companies for growth/turnaround.

## Key Topics

### 1. Understand the intro context
- What did Mark Kirschner share about fCPO? Is there a specific portfolio company pain point, or exploratory?
- What's Beringer's current approach to product leadership across portfolio? Do they have a go-to resource?

### 2. Beringer's portfolio — where product leadership gaps exist
- **Dig Insights** (Toronto) — SaaS platform Upsiide in services-to-SaaS transition. 3 of 4 founders just stepped back. Classic fCPO engagement: product strategy, roadmap, pricing/packaging, SaaS scaling. **Strongest fit in portfolio.**
- **Northern Commerce** (London, ON) — $68M digital consultancy, just acquired Freedom Marketing + Project 3 Consulting (Mar 2025). CEO is Mark Kelley (Beringer operating partner). Needs unified product/service strategy across 3 merged entities. Potential to productize IP.
- **Bold Orange** (Minneapolis) — CX agency, 160+ employees, acquired Aug 2025 from Mountaingate. Post-acquisition growth phase. Services-to-platform opportunity — productize methodologies, build proprietary CX tools.
- **VeraData** (Fort Myers) — $100M+ nonprofit data science company, "Donor Science" AI platform. Founder-led. Could benefit from product strategy to expand self-serve SaaS capabilities.

### 3. fCPO value proposition for PE
- CTCT case study: managed $70M product budget, 50% mobile conversion lift, best growth month in 11 years, doubled activation in 4 months — all within 9 months
- Portfolio-level resource: one relationship with fCPO = product leadership available across all portfolio companies
- Product diligence: fCPO can support Beringer's acquisition evaluation process — assess product maturity, tech debt, roadmap viability, team capability before deals close
- Post-acquisition integration: product strategy for newly acquired companies (exactly what Northern Commerce and Bold Orange need right now)

### 4. Dave's operating background — connect on shared language
- He's an operator (Acerno COO, Channel Factory COO) — speak in P&L terms, not theory
- He understands data-driven monetization (MSN yield management, Acerno behavioral targeting) — our CTCT work on activation and conversion is directly relatable
- He's done the build-to-exit cycle himself ($95M exit) — he knows what PE value creation looks like from the inside

## Questions
1. "What prompted Mark to connect us — is there a specific portfolio company you had in mind, or more of a general conversation?"
2. "How does Beringer currently handle product leadership across the portfolio? Is that typically left to each company's CEO, or do you bring in specialized resources?"
3. "I noticed Dig Insights is going through a leadership transition with founders stepping back — how is the product side being managed through that?"
4. "Northern Commerce just integrated two acquisitions. How are you thinking about unifying their service offerings into a cohesive product strategy?"
5. "When Beringer evaluates new acquisitions, how much weight do you put on product maturity vs. revenue? Is product diligence a formal part of your process?"
6. "What would make this conversation worth a follow-up — is there a specific portfolio company where you'd want to see what fCPO could do?"

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Understand why Mark connected us and what problem Dave is trying to solve
- [ ] Identify 1-2 portfolio companies where fCPO could engage
- [ ] Plant the "portfolio-level resource" and "product diligence" concepts
- [ ] Get a concrete next step: intro to portfolio company CEO, or follow-up with Beringer partners
- [ ] Leave with a specific date for next touchpoint — don't let this drift

## Status
**PRE-MEETING** — First contact. Relationship-building + opportunity identification. Not a close call.
