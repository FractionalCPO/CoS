      FROM COURTNEY 1:1 (Feb 23):
      PRICING: $54K assessment (6wk: 4 core + 2 buffer). Anchor at $54K, let them win at $50K. $2,450/day engagement rate. Volume discounts: 5% Q2, 10% Q3, 15% Q4, 20% max. Need MSA termination protection for volume discounts.
      CANDIDATE: Thais is primary. Ex-Google, VP Product at YellowBird. Shape Up practitioner. Available NOW but won't be in 6 months (flight risk). $200/hr contractor rate. Shane as secondary builder role post-assessment. Mirage deprioritized (trust issues). Ryan too expensive ($800K+ range).
      ASSESSMENT STRUCTURE: Wk 1-2 discovery/audit/data + ~20 stakeholder interviews. Wk 3 synthesis + insight verification. Wk 4 deliver findings + execution planning + fCPO recruiting. Wk 5-6 buffer + match operator. Three pillars: Product Strategy, GTM Strategy, Execution/Ops.
      PROPOSAL FORMAT: Notion memo (NOT a deck). "We're not consultants. We do work." Walk them through on call. Ends with pricing.
      STRATEGIC PLAY: VeraData is the entry to Beringer portfolio (4-5 companies). Accept thin margins. "Be the fractional on record for Beringer." Clear Lake Capital also being pursued separately.
      CLIENT NEEDS: Project sponsor (CEO/ELT), designated ELT contact (prefer Matt), formal team intros, data system access, customer call recordings, Beringer investment memo.
      URGENCY LEVERS: "We have someone for this. If this goes beyond 10 days we might not have them." Don't reveal Thais is locked — frame as needing to line it up.
      MSA: Courtney simplifying. W-8 needed (Canadian corp → US client). Insurance quote today. Target: MSA+SOW out same day if call goes well.
      POST-MEETING (2026-02-24): Update this task based on call outcome — advance to complete if proposal delivered, or update subtasks with next steps.
