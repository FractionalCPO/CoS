      COMPLETE 2026-02-24. Meeting happened 4-5PM ET. Proposal presented successfully.
      ACTUAL PRICING PRESENTED: $150K fixed (4wk assessment + 2wk buffer). Ongoing: $2,500/day (discounted from $4,500), 3mo minimum ($120K).
      POSITIVE SIGNALS: Price not immediately rejected, Mike engaged with data questions, MSA requested for legal review, hour-long call.
      CONCERNS (from Courtney debrief 10pm): Not speaking to actual decision-maker, presentation quality below expectations, small co not ideal ICP.
      NEXT STEPS: Send MSA+SOW+memo (see task-015). Follow up next week. Decision expected end of Feb / early March.
      STRATEGIC NOTE: Assessment model may need refinement — "discovery" framing more palatable than "assessment." Variable pricing for smaller companies discussed.

      NEEDS VAHID. References ready: Frank Brunetti + Diego. Also created as Notion task.
      UPDATE 2026-02-25 (Partner L10): Delivery pushed to Feb 26. MSA undergoing major rework:
      - 'Consultant' → 'FractionalCPO' throughout, 'personnel' defined upfront
      - 3mo minimum term, discount structures for longer commitments
      - No client veto on personnel (escalation clause instead)
      - Remote-first policy, client pays travel
      - 80% base salary liquidated damages for non-solicitation
      - Two SOW versions needed: fixed fee (assessment) + T&M (ongoing)
      - Ryan doing MSA cleanup tonight. Courtney generated alt Section 7 for fixed fee.
      - 10am meeting tomorrow (MSA + SOW sync / finalize) with Ryan + Courtney.
      - Vahid: review SOW and both Section 7 versions before 10am meeting.
      - Vahid: email VeraData/Behringer re: one-day delay (may already be done).
